Since I never saw my father or mother and never saw a resemblance between the two (because their days were long before the days of the photographs), my first fantasies about how they were unreasonably stemmed from their headstones. The shape of the letters on my father's headstones gave me a strange idea that he was a square, stocky, dark man with curly black hair.

It was a good decision - I had a wonderful time! The locals were really friendly and after a while I even started to understand the Edinburgh accent. In fact, I loved Edinburgh so much that I stayed after university. Initially I lived and worked in the city, but after meeting my husband (who is a real Scot!) we moved to the nearby countryside. I now work from home as I have my own business, but I love going to the city on weekends with my mini.
