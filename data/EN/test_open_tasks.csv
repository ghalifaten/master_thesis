3,3924,6JC58Id3Xpj8AdzXgZ53lQ,EN,Define the elements of negligence in relation to the case of John vs. Tree Safe Solutions (TSS).,"The City Government Spaces Authority (CGSA) responsible for urban parks, initiated a project to enhance safety in Central Park by
assessing and maintaining old trees. Over three weeks in April, CGSA, in collaboration with the Tree Health Committee (THC),
conducted thorough inspections and decided to implement THC&#39;s recommendations to either remove or prune any trees that showed
signs of disease or structural weakness. THC directly supervised the inspections carried out by the contracted company, Tree Safe
Solutions (TSS).
On 15 July, after a period of heavy rainfall, an old oak tree in Central Park, which had been inspected and cleared by THC and TSS,
unexpectedly fell onto a picnic area. The falling tree resulted in serious injuries to several people, including John, who suffered a
broken leg and other injuries. Post-incident investigations revealed that the tree had significant internal rot, which had not been
detected during the inspection.
The accident attracted widespread media attention, raising public concerns about the safety of other trees in the park. John, alarmed
by the incident, contacted CGSA for information about the safety measures in place. CGSA, relying on THC&#39;s supervision and TSS&#39;s
inspection reports, assured John that the trees in the park were safe and posed no further risks. Trusting this assurance, John
continued his regular activities in the park.
On 20 September, another tree that had been inspected and deemed safe by THC and TSS, fell near John while he was jogging,
causing him to trip and reinjure his leg. This incident necessitated additional medical treatment and significantly impacted John&#39;s daily
life and work.
Meanwhile, Sarah, who runs a small café near the park, noticed a significant drop in business after the first tree incident. Concerned
about the ongoing safety of the park, she reached out to CGSA for reassurance, explaining that her business depended on park
visitors. CGSA, based on the reports from THC and TSS, assured Sarah that the park was safe and that no further incidents were
expected. Relying on this assurance, Sarah decided to invest in expanding her outdoor seating area to attract more customers.
However, after the second tree incident, park attendance dropped even further, causing Sarah significant financial loss due to her
recent investment.
John and Sarah now seek legal advice on whether they can pursue a negligence claim against any party regarding their injuries and
losses, focusing on the negligent misstatement by CGSA about the safety of the trees. Assess whether the elements of negligence,

specifically negligent misstatement, are present and discuss any potential defenses. Also, briefly consider the remedies they might
be entitled to if their claims are successful.
Support your advice with references to relevant case law and legislation. You do not need to reference any information outside the
provided details and your general knowledge. Where facts are ambiguous, make reasonable inferences. Mention any ambiguities
and the inferences you draw to ensure comprehensive advice. Avoid discussing other areas of law, such as consumer protection or
criminal law, and limit your analysis to the applicable Civil Wrongs Act. Assume no statutory duties are involved in this scenario.
Focus on potential liabilities of identified parties, and do not consider the quantum of damages but rather the appropriate heads of
damages (e.g., loss of income). Do not address the apportionment of liability among multiple wrongdoers, if applicable.",,17

So I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip. I give Pirrip as my father's family name, on the authority of his tombstone and my sister — Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith. As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness of either of them (for their days were long before the days of photographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like were unreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on my father's gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man with curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription, ""also Georgiana wife of the above,"" I drew a childish conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly. To five little stone lozenges, each about a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside their grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of mine—who gave up trying to get a living exceedingly early in that universal struggle — I am indebted for a belief I religiously entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands in their trowsers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state of existence.

los verbos y sus composiciones

3.1. El verbo y sus componentes
El verbo es una pieza fundamental de nuestra lengua. Por ejemplo, en la oración Los lunes
paseábamos por el bosque, ¿qué información aporta la palabra paseábamos?
Transmite una acción: pasear, es decir, ""andar por distracción o ejercicio"".

Advierte de que la acción no solo la realiza una persona, sino más de una: (Nosotros o nosotras)
paseábamos.
Además, especifica que es una acción que se realiza en el pasado.

Para cambiar el sujeto o el tiempo de la acción, es suficiente con cambiar el verbo. Por
ejemplo:
Paseo todos los lunes (1.a persona del singular, presente).
Pasearéis el lunes (2.a persona del plural, futuro).

Los verbos son palabras que expresan una acción (escribir, comer), un estado (estar) o un
proceso (vivir, crecer). Junto con los nombres, adjetivos, adverbios, pronombres, conjunciones,
preposiciones y artículos, son una de las ocho clases de palabras que existen.
Los verbos son palabras variables y sus variaciones se producen cuando se añaden afijos
flexivos, en forma de desinencia verbal. Estas pueden ser de modo, tiempo, número y persona.

Diferenciar los verbos de acción de los verbos de estado
Actividad que consiste en diferenciar los verbos de estado ylos verbos de
acción

A veces, se puede dudar de si un adjetivo, un nombre o un adverbio son o no verbos, porque tienen
una raíz muy parecida. Por ejemplo: acción, accionar, accionado.
Para identificar los verbos, hay que observar si la palabra presenta desinencias verbales. Por
ejemplo: accionary accionado pueden ser verbos porque contienen las desinencias verbales -ar
(infinitivo) y-ado (participio). Sin embargo, acción no puede ser un verbo porque no tiene ninguna
desinencia verbal.

3.1.1. Las formas verbales características del verbo

Las formas del verbo
El verbo presenta diferentes formas en función de la información de sus morfemas (como cantaba,
canté o cantado). Existen formas personales y no personales.
La mayor parte de las formas verbales expresan información sobre el número, la persona, el tiempo,
el modo y el aspecto mediante las desinencias. Estas formas reciben el nombre de formas
personales.
En el caso de un verbo como tendías, se puede deducir por su desinencia (-ías) que la acción la
realiza una segunda persona del singular.

Los tiempos del verbo
Las formas personales del verbo pueden indicar tres tiempos distintos: presente, pasado yfuturo.

La referencia temporal para definir si se trata de pasado, presente o futuro es el momento en el que
quien habla emite el mensaje. Por lo tanto:
El presente coincide con el tiempo en el que quien habla emite el mensaje.
El pasado indica un tiempo anterior al momento en que quien habla emite el mensaje.
El futuro se refiere a un tiempo posterior al momento en que quien habla emite el mensaje.

Sin embargo, existen matices dentro de estos tres tiempos verbales, ya que quien habla puede

Para saber más
Perífrasis verbales
Las perífrasis verbales son combinaciones de dos (o más) verbos que funcionan en bloque,
como si fueran un único verbo, y que designan una única acción, como ocurre con las formas
compuestas. Las perífrasis aportan valores modales: cómo enfoca la acción quien habla; y
aspectuales: cómo se desarrolla la acción.
Están compuestas por un verbo auxiliar, que pierde su significado léxico y aporta los
accidentes verbales, y por un verbo principal en forma no personal, que aporta el significado
léxico a la perífrasis. Entre estos dos verbos puede aparecer, además, alguna palabra que
funcione como nexo (una preposición o una conjunción).
Por ejemplo:
Tener que + infinitivo

Tengo que estudiar para el examen de mañana.

Estar + gerundio

Mi madre está leyendo una novela policíaca.

3.2. Los tipos de verbo
Los verbos tienen un significado, una función y una forma. Así, en la oración Siempre canto en la
ducha, el verbo cantar posee las siguientes características:
Tiene el significado de ""emitir sonidos de manera armoniosa"".
Cumple una función en la oración que consiste en concordar con el sujeto de la oración (yo) e
introducir el complemento (en la ducha).
Presenta una forma regular, ya que se conjuga de manera uniforme, igual que otros verbos
acabados en -ar, como bailar o soñar.
3.2.1. Verbos regulares e irregulares
Los verbos se clasifican según su terminación. Es muyimportante saber cómo termina el infinitivo
de un verbo para conjugarlo de manera correcta después.
Los infinitivos de los verbos pueden terminar de tres formas diferentes.

Actividad que permite aplicar lo que los alumnos han aprendido sobre las
conjugaciones verbales

No todos los verbos de la misma terminación se conjugan igual. Por ejemplo: si se comparan los
presentes del verbo cantar, del verbo bailary del verbo estar, la primera persona sería yo canto, yo
bailo yyo estoy. Este último verbo no se conjuga igual que los otros.
Los verbos que se conjugan siguiendo el modelo se llaman regulares, ylos que sufren
modificaciones se llaman irregulares. Por lo tanto, el verbo estar es irregular.

3.2.2. La función verbal

Desde el punto de vista de la función, los verbos se pueden clasificar en dos tipos: verbos auxiliares y
predicativos.
Verbos auxiliares
Los verbos auxiliares son verbos que pierden su significado para ayudar a otros, que son los que
aportan el significado léxico y que se conjugan de forma no personal. Por ejemplo: había cantado.
Son verbos auxiliares:
El verbo haber para formas compuestas. Por ejemplo: He cantado.
El verbo ser para formas pasivas. Por ejemplo: Fue construido.
Los verbos poder, deber e ir: Puedes escribir; Debes estudiar; Voy a cantar.

Los auxiliares son como salvavidas verbales: mantienen en la superficie el significado de
otros verbos.

Verbos predicativos
Los verbos predicativos (también llamados plenos) son verbos con significado propio que expresan
acciones, procesos o estados. Constituyen el núcleo semántico y sintáctico del predicado verbal. Son
verbos predicativos todos, excepto ser, estar y parecer. Por ejemplo: correr, estudiar, hablar, pensar,
abrir, dormir, construir, etc.
3.2.3. El significado verbal
Desde el punto de vista del significado, los verbos se pueden clasificar en dos tipos: verbos
predicativos (que también se clasifican por su función, como ya se ha visto) y copulativos.
Verbos copulativos
Los verbos copulativos tienen poco significado por sí mismos y su función consiste en unir el sujeto
con su cualidad (llamada en sintaxis atributo). Son el núcleo sintáctico del predicado nominal. Los
verbos copulativos son ser, estar y parecer.

3.3. Estructuras argumentales
Los verbos no siempre van solos en la oración. Muchas veces están acompañados de otras palabras,
de complementos que permiten completar su significado. Se llama estructura argumental a la
cantidad de elementos que requiere una unidad léxica para completar su sentido.

Como en un edificio, las oraciones ylos verbos necesitan de una estructura que ""sostenga"" su
significado.

3.3.1. Argumentos

A veces, es necesario usar alguno de estos complementos porque, si no, las oraciones no tendrían
sentido. En ese caso, los complementos se llaman argumentos. Por ejemplo:
Tú escribes una poesía. (Complemento directo con verbo transitivo)
El cartero entregó la carta al portero. (Complemento indirecto)
El niño está triste. (Atributo con verbo copulativo)
Este recinto fue diseñado por mi vecino. (Complemento agente en oración pasiva)
Me avergüenzo de tu actitud. (Complemento de régimen)
3.3.2. Adjuntos
Otros complementos, sin embargo, no son obligatorios porque sin ellos la oración tiene significado
completo. Estos complementos que solo aportan más detalles al significado de la oración se
denominan adjuntos. Por ejemplo:
La niña compró un libro a su amigo. (Complemento indirecto)
El estudiante respondió las preguntas al instante. (Complemento circunstancial)
Verónica encontró cansados a los niños. (Complemento predicativo)

58,3905,8hW5143vdgva4PKovWxXap,EN,Expand this linear expression using the distributive property. ${5(3x + y - 8)}$,"Understanding the Concept: The distributive property is a rule that helps break down expressions with parentheses into simpler parts. Think of it as distributing or spreading a number across all items inside the parentheses.

Why It’s Useful: This rule is fundamental in algebra and helps simplify expressions, making them easier to work with and solve.

How It Works:

Identify the number outside the parentheses.
This number needs to be multiplied by each individual part inside the parentheses, one at a time.
Step-by-Step Process:

Start with the expression that has a number outside and multiple parts inside the parentheses.
Multiply the number outside by the first part inside the parentheses.
Next, multiply the same number by the second part inside the parentheses.
Continue this process for each part inside the parentheses.
Combine all these results to form a new, simpler expression without parentheses.
Visualizing the Process: Imagine you have several items in a bag, and you have multiple such bags. To find the total number of each item, you would multiply the number of bags by the number of each item in one bag and add them up.

Real-Life Application: Picture buying multiple bundles of products. If each bundle contains various items, you would multiply the number of bundles by the quantity of each item in a single bundle to find the total for each item.

Practice Makes Perfect: To get better at this, practice with different expressions to get used to distributing the number across all parts inside the parentheses and combining the results.",,13

I grabbed all my money, which was less than a dollar. Then I was ready to go. I went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad. I was walking up Carbine Street towards the clubhouse when Chris caught up with me. His eyes were shining. “Gordie! You want to see something?” “Sure. What?” “Come down here first.” He pointed down an alley between two shops. “What is it, Chris?” “Come on, I said!” He ran down the alley and I ran after him. At the bottom, the smell from the trash was terrible. “Chris, I’m going to puke, I’m – ” But I forgot about the smell when Chris put his hand into his backpack and pulled out a big gun. “Where did you get that?” “From my dad’s desk.” “Man, your dad’s going to beat you when he finds out.” Chris’s eyes just went on dancing. “He isn’t going to find out. He and his friends have got enough wine to keep them drunk for a week. I’ll put it back before then.” Chris hated alcohol – he’d already seen too much of what it can do. He was the only one of us who didn’t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they’d stolen from their father. “Have you got bullets for it?” “Nine of them – all that was left in the box. He’ll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.” “Any in it at the moment?” “No, of course not. What do you think I am?” I finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA – BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin – it was the work of an evil magician. “Wow!” I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn’t tell if he was amused or scared. “You did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!” “Shut up! Let’s go!” I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. “Man, it’s a pity you couldn’t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.” “You knew there was a bullet in it, didn’t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.” “I didn’t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad’s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.” Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, “What do you think we need a gun for?” “Nothing, really,” Chris said. “Except we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it’s frightening out in the forest at night.” Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?” Teddy asked Vern. “Yeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it’ll look as if we’re there after dark.” “Hey, man, great!” I said, and slapped Vern on the back. For him, that was real thinking. He grinned. “So let’s go,” Teddy said. “It’s nearly twelve already.” Chris stood up and we gathered round him. “We’ll walk across Beeman’s field,” he said, “and then we’ll get to the railway tracks and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.” “How far is it, do you think?” Teddy asked. “I don’t know,” said Chris. “Harlow’s big. We’re going to have to walk at least twenty miles. Does that sound right to you, Gordie?” “Yeah. Maybe more – thirty miles.” “Come on, you guys,” Chris said, and picked up his backpack, blankets and water bottle.   Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? headline written by Pam Warner (published 07/12/16 in Health & Style ) author, date, source What is your Thanksgiving like? Turkey and pumpkin pie? American football on the sofa? In the last couple of years a new trend has become popular in the USA: More people like to eat better quality food and live a more active life. introduction It is slowly going out of fashion to live off convenience and frozen food. A number of people shop for organic food at special supermarkets instead. In some states farmers’ markets offer a great variety of fresh vegetables and fruit from the region. “There are also dairy products, bread and meat without chemical additives at these markets. Organic food is not only much healthier but it tastes a lot better as well,” explains Emma from Boston. So how about some healthy recipes for Thanksgiving? Maybe pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes? A roast turkey breast or a turkey roulade filled with apples and cranberries is delicious too. But there’s more to a healthy lifestyle than just food. A lot of trend sports show that you can have fun, spend time with friends and stay fit at the same time. Have you found the right sport for you yet? If not, here is a suggestion: How about standup paddleboarding? If you like water, that’s the ideal kind of sport for you. You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don’t worry, you don’t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: “Drinking too much alcohol isn’t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?” Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don’t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion   A first date Dylan often thought about Abby.

What’s your favourite pizza, Luke?” Luke didn’t answer. “Did you hear me?” asked Gwen. “Sorry. I’m playing this game on my phone,” said Luke. “I have a really high score. Look!” “I can’t see that,” said Gwen. “Sorry. I forgot you have a problem with your eyes,” said Luke. “You forgot Dave’s birthday. You forgot your homework. You forget everything,” said Gwen. “No, I don’t,” said Luke. He looked out of the window. “Oh no! This is my stop. I forgot where we are! Bye Gwen, see you tomorrow.” Luke rushed down the stairs and got off the bus. He wanted to finish his game. He put his hand in his pocket, but his phone wasn’t there! “Oh no, I must have forgotten it on the bus!” He looked up. But the bus wasn’t there any more. Luke went home and phoned the bus company. They wanted to help but first they needed a special number from his phone – and he didn’t know the number! Luke didn’t enjoy his dinner at all that night. Why wasn’t he more careful with his phone? Suddenly the doorbell rang. “Gwen’s here!” shouted Luke’s mum from the hall. Luke went to the door. Gwen and her dad were there. “I heard something fall on the floor when you got off the bus,” said Gwen. “I asked a woman to see what it was.” Gwen gave Luke his phone. “Wow!” said Luke. “Today is my lucky day! Thanks, Gwen.” “That’s what friends are for!” said Gwen. “Come on, Gwen. Let’s get that pizza!” said Gwen’s dad. Luke put his phone in his pocket. It really was his lucky day. Maybe he could get his best ever high score too.   How I won a prize The TV show ‘Teen chef of the year’ tries to find the UK’s best young chef. Twenty-four kids took part in the competition this year. They cooked lots of different meals for the judges – three chefs. The kids also answered many questions about food. At the end of the competition one kid was the winner – and that kid was me! My name is Joe Reedman. My entry form for the show: Entry form: Teen chef of the year Age: ‬13 Favourite food: scrambled eggs Favourite meal: breakfast Why I started: When I was six, I watched my mum in the kitchen.

Old woman Why do young people always want to go to London? It’s dirty and not safe. Dora That’s not true. It’s the most amazing city in the world. And it’s the place where dreams come true 1 . London is the place for me! Old woman I don’t think so. It’s an awful place. (Dora looks down the road. There is the sound of a bus.) Dora Here’s my bus. Oh … and my name’s Dora White. Remember that name, because you’ll hear it again 2 when I’m famous. (Dora takes her bag. The old woman shakes her head. The lights go down 3 .) Narrator When Dora arrives in London, she gets a job.

I want to be with my friends. But I’m not. Mum and Dad sent me to stay with Aunt Susan for six long days. To a village! In the middle of nowhere. All you can see are fields, trees and some animals. There are no shops, no cafés and no buses. No skate park either! It’s so boring! How can people live here? There was a party in the village this evening. But it wasn’t fun. There was a barbecue 1 and then singing and dancing. But the music was awful. I was so bored that I turned their music off and played some hip-hop 2 instead. Everybody was mad and shouted at me. I laughed at them and left. I hate this place and I hate these people. How can birds be so loud? Some of them started singing at four in the morning! Later the church bells 3 rang 4 . Nothing happened today. Just another boring day. When can I go home? Nothing! Aunt Susan wanted me to help with the cows and in the garden, but I stayed in my room and watched films. The village boys tried to pick me up for a football game. I told them that I didn’t have my football shoes and couldn’t play. I can’t believe what happened last night. I woke up in the middle of the night because there was a loud noise in the house. I went to the kitchen and saw Aunt Susan there. She was on the phone, and she was very excited. When she saw me, she told me to come with her. Rosalie needed help. I didn’t know who Rosalie was. I was surprised when I saw that Rosalie was one of Aunt Susan’s cows. She needed help with her calf. Some other people from the village were there too. They were all very calm and knew what to do. They told me to hold the light so that the vet could see well. I could hardly look. That noise! And it smelt terrible. Yuck! 5 Then it was there. A little calf. So sweet, so clumsy. We all felt very happy. I was so tired but so excited. I got up early again. I just had to see if the calf was OK. It was. It stood next to Rosalie and drank its milk. It’s the most beautiful little cow I’ve ever seen 6 . I think I’ll ask Aunt Susan if I can come back again. I think it’s not that bad here. ___ 1 barbecue – Grillparty ; 2 hip-hop – Hip Hop (Musikrichtung) ; 3 bell – die Glocke ; 4 ring – läuten ; 5 yuck – igitt 6 the most beautiful cow I’ve ever seen – die schönste Kuh, die ich je gesehen habe   Dan’s holidays in the country Holidays!

Look!” “I can’t see that,” said Gwen. “Sorry. I forgot you have a problem with your eyes,” said Luke. “You forgot Dave’s birthday. You forgot your homework. You forget everything,” said Gwen. “No, I don’t,” said Luke. He looked out of the window. “Oh no! This is my stop. I forgot where we are! Bye Gwen, see you tomorrow.” Luke rushed down the stairs and got off the bus. He wanted to finish his game. He put his hand in his pocket, but his phone wasn’t there! “Oh no, I must have forgotten it on the bus!” He looked up. But the bus wasn’t there any more. Luke went home and phoned the bus company. They wanted to help but first they needed a special number from his phone – and he didn’t know the number! Luke didn’t enjoy his dinner at all that night. Why wasn’t he more careful with his phone? Suddenly the doorbell rang. “Gwen’s here!” shouted Luke’s mum from the hall. Luke went to the door. Gwen and her dad were there. “I heard something fall on the floor when you got off the bus,” said Gwen. “I asked a woman to see what it was.” Gwen gave Luke his phone. “Wow!” said Luke. “Today is my lucky day! Thanks, Gwen.” “That’s what friends are for!” said Gwen. “Come on, Gwen. Let’s get that pizza!” said Gwen’s dad. Luke put his phone in his pocket. It really was his lucky day. Maybe he could get his best ever high score too.   How I won a prize The TV show ‘Teen chef of the year’ tries to find the UK’s best young chef. Twenty-four kids took part in the competition this year. They cooked lots of different meals for the judges – three chefs. The kids also answered many questions about food. At the end of the competition one kid was the winner – and that kid was me! My name is Joe Reedman. My entry form for the show: Entry form: Teen chef of the year Age: ‬13 Favourite food: scrambled eggs Favourite meal: breakfast Why I started: When I was six, I watched my mum in the kitchen. She was making a cake. The eggs, milk and flour became a delicious cake and it was like magic. I wanted to do magic cooking too! Ambition: to have my own restaurant   The amazing story of Dora White Narrator Dora White lives in the small village of Aldham, many miles from London. (A girl and an old woman are at a bus stop in the village. The girl has a bag. She has money in her hands.) Dora One, two, three, four pounds fifty. Yes! I have enough money for the bus to London. Old woman Why do young people always want to go to London? It’s dirty and not safe. Dora That’s not true. It’s the most amazing city in the world. And it’s the place where dreams come true 1 . London is the place for me! Old woman I don’t think so. It’s an awful place. (Dora looks down the road. There is the sound of a bus.) Dora Here’s my bus. Oh … and my name’s Dora White. Remember that name, because you’ll hear it again 2 when I’m famous. (Dora takes her bag. The old woman shakes her head. The lights go down 3 .) Narrator When Dora arrives in London, she gets a job. (Dora is in a busy restaurant kitchen. She is doing the washing up 4 . A chef and a waiter are in the kitchen. There are dirty plates, glasses and pots next to Dora.) Waiter I need six plates and glasses now! Dora One moment, please. Chef Work faster. I need three clean pots now. Dora Yes, chef. Chef Where are they? I need them now! Dora You can have them in a minute. I’m busy with these plates. (Dora gives the plates to the waiter.) Waiter These plates are dirty! Dora I’m sorry! Chef You are useless! Dora No, I’m not. Chef You can go, Nora! Never come back! Dora It’s not Nora. It’s Dora. Dora White. Remember that name, because you’ll hear it again when I’m famous. (Dora exits the stage 5 on the right. The waiter and the chef shake their heads.) (The lights go down.) Narrator Dora’s life in London isn’t like it was in her dreams. (Dora is at a London bus stop with her bag. She looks very sad.) Dora Maybe London isn’t the place for me. (Dora sees a leaflet on the road. She takes it and looks at it.) (She reads from the leaflet.) Three Lions Hotel. We need kitchen workers for our very special restaurant. We are a friendly restaurant, but you must be hard-working and determined. (Dora smiles and stands up straight. There is the sound of a bus.) Bus driver (From off the stage 6 , on the left) Do you want to get on? This is the last bus to Aldham today. Dora No thanks. I want to stay here. London is the place for me. (A young woman walks past Dora.) Dora Excuse me. Can you tell me the way to the Three Lions Hotel, please? Young woman The Three Lions Hotel? Yes, of course. Go straight on. It’s on the right. Dora Thank you. Goodbye! (She takes her bag happily and starts to walk. The lights go down.) ___ 1 where dreams come true – wo Träume wahr werden ; 2 you’ll hear it again – Sie werden davon hören ; 3 the lights go down – die Lichter gehen aus ; 4 doing the washing up – den Abwasch machen ; 5 exits the stage – verlässt die Bühne ; 6 from off stage – aus dem Off (aus dem Hintergrund)   Dan’s holidays in the country Holidays! I want to be with my friends. But I’m not. Mum and Dad sent me to stay with Aunt Susan for six long days. To a village! In the middle of nowhere. All you can see are fields, trees and some animals. There are no shops, no cafés and no buses. No skate park either! It’s so boring! How can people live here? There was a party in the village this evening. But it wasn’t fun. There was a barbecue 1 and then singing and dancing. But the music was awful. I was so bored that I turned their music off and played some hip-hop 2 instead. Everybody was mad and shouted at me. I laughed at them and left. I hate this place and I hate these people. How can birds be so loud? Some of them started singing at four in the morning! Later the church bells 3 rang 4 . Nothing happened today. Just another boring day. When can I go home? Nothing! Aunt Susan wanted me to help with the cows and in the garden, but I stayed in my room and watched films. The village boys tried to pick me up for a football game. I told them that I didn’t have my football shoes and couldn’t play. I can’t believe what happened last night. I woke up in the middle of the night because there was a loud noise in the house. I went to the kitchen and saw Aunt Susan there. She was on the phone, and she was very excited. When she saw me, she told me to come with her. Rosalie needed help. I didn’t know who Rosalie was. I was surprised when I saw that Rosalie was one of Aunt Susan’s cows. She needed help with her calf. Some other people from the village were there too. They were all very calm and knew what to do. They told me to hold the light so that the vet could see well. I could hardly look. That noise! And it smelt terrible. Yuck! 5 Then it was there. A little calf. So sweet, so clumsy. We all felt very happy. I was so tired but so excited. I got up early again. I just had to see if the calf was OK. It was. It stood next to Rosalie and drank its milk. It’s the most beautiful little cow I’ve ever seen 6 . I think I’ll ask Aunt Susan if I can come back again. I think it’s not that bad here. ___ 1 barbecue – Grillparty ; 2 hip-hop – Hip Hop (Musikrichtung) ; 3 bell – die Glocke ; 4 ring – läuten ; 5 yuck – igitt 6 the most beautiful cow I’ve ever seen – die schönste Kuh, die ich je gesehen habe ",,35
