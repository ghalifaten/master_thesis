27,7HvXcqMsD1k6pqiCuLhyL4,eng,"Read the following text and answer the question below: A chimpanzee uses its face to express different feelings. It grins or sneers to show it is excited or afraid. It presses its lips together if it wants to impress another chimp. When it plays, a chimp generally has an open smile with its top teeth covered. Apart from its face, a chimp also uses body language to communicate. For example, its hair stands on end when it is excited. That reaction can also mean that it is afraid. When it is aggressive, it usually raises its arms or hits the ground and stares at another animal. A chimp normally produces more than 15 different types of call. For example, there is a special identification call that will help its family find it. When chimps play, they often make a sound similar to our laughter. Body contact is very important for preserving harmony in a group of chimpanzees. That is why chimpanzees often groom each other for hours. It helps them stay calm and creates feelings of friendship.

57,9Mc5FyG63rf6kYt9niCyf1,eng,"Great Expectations by Charles Dickens My father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip, my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than Pip. So I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip. I give Pirrip as my father's family name, on the authority of his tombstone and my sister — Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith. As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness of either of them (for their days were long before the days of photographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like were unreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on my father's gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man with curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription, ""also Georgiana wife of the above,"" I drew a childish conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly. To five little stone lozenges, each about a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside their grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of mine—who gave up trying to get a living exceedingly early in that universal struggle — I am indebted for a belief I religiously entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands in their trowsers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state of existence.

Find more information about the product here: digione.ch Why I love Edinburgh I first visited Edinburgh as a child with my parents and my sister. I thought it was a magical city with a very special atmosphere. It’s small enough to get around easily and not feel lost, but big enough that there’s a lot to do. So after I left school, I decided to go to university there. It was a good decision – I had a wonderful time! The locals were really friendly and after some time I even started to understand the Edinburgh accent. In fact, I loved Edinburgh so much that I stayed after university. At first I lived and worked in the city, but after I met my husband (who is a true Scotsman!) we moved to the countryside nearby. I work from home now as I have my own business. But I love to drive to the city at the weekend in my Mini. Last week my parents came to stay and we visited Edinburgh Castle and the Scottish National Gallery. One day we took the children to the zoo, and another day we took a boat out to Inchcolm Abbey on a nearby island. Most days we had a picnic lunch in the Princes Street Gardens.I love that there are so many different things to do in Edinburgh. This city really has become my home now. I couldn’t imagine moving away! Answer the question in a full sentence: Why did Caroline move to Edinburgh? (""She moved to Edinburgh to study and because she loved the city.”)",,271

The Body In “The Body”, Gordie Lachance and his three friends learn that a boy from their area, in the state of Maine, has disappeared and is probably dead. They decide to go on a trip to find the boy’s body and prepare for the trip. The Gun My room was on the second floor, and it was really hot up there. I was glad I wasn’t sleeping there that night, and the thought of where we were going made me excited again. I rolled up two blankets and tied an old belt around them. I grabbed all my money, which was less than a dollar. Then I was ready to go. I went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad. I was walking up Carbine Street towards the clubhouse when Chris caught up with me. His eyes were shining. “Gordie! You want to see something?” “Sure. What?” “Come down here first.” He pointed down an alley between two shops. “What is it, Chris?” “Come on, I said!” He ran down the alley and I ran after him. At the bottom, the smell from the trash was terrible. “Chris, I’m going to puke, I’m – ” But I forgot about the smell when Chris put his hand into his backpack and pulled out a big gun. “Where did you get that?” “From my dad’s desk.” “Man, your dad’s going to beat you when he finds out.” Chris’s eyes just went on dancing. “He isn’t going to find out. He and his friends have got enough wine to keep them drunk for a week. I’ll put it back before then.” Chris hated alcohol – he’d already seen too much of what it can do. He was the only one of us who didn’t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they’d stolen from their father. “Have you got bullets for it?” “Nine of them – all that was left in the box. He’ll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.” “Any in it at the moment?” “No, of course not. What do you think I am?” I finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA – BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin – it was the work of an evil magician. “Wow!” I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn’t tell if he was amused or scared. “You did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!” “Shut up! Let’s go!” I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. “Man, it’s a pity you couldn’t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.” “You knew there was a bullet in it, didn’t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.” “I didn’t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad’s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.” Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, “What do you think we need a gun for?” “Nothing, really,” Chris said. “Except we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it’s frightening out in the forest at night.” Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?” Teddy asked Vern. “Yeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it’ll look as if we’re there after dark.” “Hey, man, great!” I said, and slapped Vern on the back. For him, that was real thinking. He grinned. “So let’s go,” Teddy said. “It’s nearly twelve already.” Chris stood up and we gathered round him. “We’ll walk across Beeman’s field,” he said, “and then we’ll get to the railway tracks and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.” “How far is it, do you think?” Teddy asked. “I don’t know,” said Chris. “Harlow’s big. We’re going to have to walk at least twenty miles. Does that sound right to you, Gordie?” “Yeah. Maybe more – thirty miles.” “Come on, you guys,” Chris said, and picked up his backpack, blankets and water bottle.",,899

Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? headline written by Pam Warner (published 07/12/16 in Health & Style ) author, date, source What is your Thanksgiving like? Turkey and pumpkin pie? American football on the sofa? In the last couple of years a new trend has become popular in the USA: More people like to eat better quality food and live a more active life. introduction It is slowly going out of fashion to live off convenience and frozen food. A number of people shop for organic food at special supermarkets instead. In some states farmers’ markets offer a great variety of fresh vegetables and fruit from the region. “There are also dairy products, bread and meat without chemical additives at these markets. Organic food is not only much healthier but it tastes a lot better as well,” explains Emma from Boston. So how about some healthy recipes for Thanksgiving? Maybe pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes? A roast turkey breast or a turkey roulade filled with apples and cranberries is delicious too. But there’s more to a healthy lifestyle than just food. A lot of trend sports show that you can have fun, spend time with friends and stay fit at the same time. Have you found the right sport for you yet? If not, here is a suggestion: How about standup paddleboarding? If you like water, that’s the ideal kind of sport for you. You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don’t worry, you don’t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: “Drinking too much alcohol isn’t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?” Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don’t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion",,1410

Interviewer There are lots of players from Latin America here. When did you immigrate to the United States? José That was twelve years ago. I was ten. Interviewer That was a big decision for your parents. They left their home and moved to a foreign place. José Yes, but they were very poor in Cuba. My father had been unemployed for a long time. My parents wanted to give me and my sisters the best chances. Interviewer What were the first years like? José My parents had problems because they hadn’t learned English in school. But there’s a strong community of Cubans here in New York. So my parents opened a small shop for other immigrants. Interviewer And how did you feel? José At the beginning I was homesick. I missed my friends. But my parents had given up a lot for me and I slowly got used to my new life. Interviewer When did you begin your baseball career? José Before I was 15, I hadn’t taken any sports seriously. Then I joined the baseball team in high school and we were very successful. After I had become the star of my team, my baseball career started. I’ve been very lucky. I can live my dream. For most people it’s much harder. Interviewer What about your plans for the future?

Oh, man, that was really great.” “You knew there was a bullet in it, didn’t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.” “I didn’t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad’s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.” Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, “What do you think we need a gun for?” “Nothing, really,” Chris said. “Except we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it’s frightening out in the forest at night.” Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?” Teddy asked Vern. “Yeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it’ll look as if we’re there after dark.” “Hey, man, great!” I said, and slapped Vern on the back. For him, that was real thinking. He grinned. “So let’s go,” Teddy said. “It’s nearly twelve already.” Chris stood up and we gathered round him. “We’ll walk across Beeman’s field,” he said, “and then we’ll get to the railway tracks and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.” “How far is it, do you think?” Teddy asked. “I don’t know,” said Chris. “Harlow’s big. We’re going to have to walk at least twenty miles. Does that sound right to you, Gordie?” “Yeah. Maybe more – thirty miles.” “Come on, you guys,” Chris said, and picked up his backpack, blankets and water bottle.   Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? headline written by Pam Warner (published 07/12/16 in Health & Style ) author, date, source What is your Thanksgiving like? Turkey and pumpkin pie? American football on the sofa? In the last couple of years a new trend has become popular in the USA: More people like to eat better quality food and live a more active life. introduction It is slowly going out of fashion to live off convenience and frozen food. A number of people shop for organic food at special supermarkets instead. In some states farmers’ markets offer a great variety of fresh vegetables and fruit from the region. “There are also dairy products, bread and meat without chemical additives at these markets. Organic food is not only much healthier but it tastes a lot better as well,” explains Emma from Boston. So how about some healthy recipes for Thanksgiving? Maybe pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes? A roast turkey breast or a turkey roulade filled with apples and cranberries is delicious too. But there’s more to a healthy lifestyle than just food. A lot of trend sports show that you can have fun, spend time with friends and stay fit at the same time. Have you found the right sport for you yet? If not, here is a suggestion: How about standup paddleboarding? If you like water, that’s the ideal kind of sport for you. You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don’t worry, you don’t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: “Drinking too much alcohol isn’t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?” Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don’t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion   A first date Dylan often thought about Abby. He really liked her. But he was too shy to ask her out on a date. Dylan’s friend Forget her. She’s not interested in you. She has a boyfriend. One day his books fell out of his locker right when Abby showed up. With Scott in tow, of course. How embarrassing. Scott Who’s that guy? Look at him! A few days later they had lunch together. Dylan helped Abby with her Science project. They didn’t notice Scott and his football friends. Scott’s friend Isn’t she your girlfriend? Dylan Let me explain. It’s not that hard! When Dylan went to the gym, the boys attacked him. Scott pushed him really hard and Dylan couldn’t do anything about it. Scott Stay away from her! Abby Stop it! You’re hurting him! A few days later Dylan asked Abby, “So, are you coming to the dance with me?” And she said yes. He was very nervous when he picked her up. Abby’s dad So, young man, you must be Dylan. The party was great. Everybody enjoyed the music and dancing. There was a big surprise that evening. Dylan and Abby were so proud. Presenter We proudly present this year’s Homecoming King and Queen. At the end of the evening Dylan took Abby home. There it was, the perfect moment. But … Abby’s dad Excuse me?   Living the dream? Interviewer Hello José. Can I ask you a few questions for our magazine, please? José Hi. Sure. Interviewer You’re new on the baseball team. Are you happy? José We won the first three matches, so I can’t complain. Interviewer There are lots of players from Latin America here. When did you immigrate to the United States? José That was twelve years ago. I was ten. Interviewer That was a big decision for your parents. They left their home and moved to a foreign place. José Yes, but they were very poor in Cuba. My father had been unemployed for a long time. My parents wanted to give me and my sisters the best chances. Interviewer What were the first years like? José My parents had problems because they hadn’t learned English in school. But there’s a strong community of Cubans here in New York. So my parents opened a small shop for other immigrants. Interviewer And how did you feel? José At the beginning I was homesick. I missed my friends. But my parents had given up a lot for me and I slowly got used to my new life. Interviewer When did you begin your baseball career? José Before I was 15, I hadn’t taken any sports seriously. Then I joined the baseball team in high school and we were very successful. After I had become the star of my team, my baseball career started. I’ve been very lucky. I can live my dream. For most people it’s much harder. Interviewer What about your plans for the future? José I’m a US citizen now and my home is here. But I plan to help people in Cuba. Interviewer Thank you for your time.   Too young to work? Many big farms in California employ children, mostly from Latin America, to pick fruit or vegetables. Children have to help their parents earn their living because migrant parents often don’t have enough income. It is difficult for them to get a better job because many of them don’t have many qualifications or can hardly speak English. Some are even in the USA illegally. All laborers have the legal right to take breaks and get water to drink in the state of California. But in reality things are different. Fresno Weekly Magazine talked to Matteo (12) and his brother Ramon (14) from Sacramento, who have been working on different farms. Fresno Weekly What are the working conditions like for you? Matteo We have to get up at 4:30 in the morning. Buses drive us to the fields, where we work all day in the heat. We sometimes work more than ten hours a day and only earn the minimum wage or even less. The long hours in the fields make you tired. Fresno Weekly Ramon, how long have you been working in the fields? Ramon Since I was ten, just like my Dad. Fresno Weekly Do you have any health problems? Ramon Yes, because of the pesticides I always have difficulty breathing and I have a constant headache out there. But that’s not all. Some people get injured working with the large machines. A federal law from 1938 allows farm owners to employ children from the age of twelve on big farms and even younger children on small farms. From the age of 14 teenagers can do farm work without their parents’ consent. Officially, they are only allowed to work outside school hours, but some of them don’t even finish high school. There are no statistics about how many children spend their days as farm helpers, but the estimate is about half a million. All recent attempts to change the law have failed.",,2070

Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy – after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world’s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren’t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is ‘fracking’, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, “Fracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.” But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada’s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. “We haven’t seen the end of this yet,” says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. “CO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.” 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven’t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won’t change. “What worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,” he adds. “It will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.” Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable – which means that when we have used them up, there simply won’t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada’s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better – and we will have to.",,785

The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn’t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship’s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the ‘northwest passage’, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn’t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship’s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It’s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn’t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we’d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn’t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn’t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back’s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can’t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let’s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I’m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown. Stephen Samuel Stanley – ship’s doctor, HMS Erebus",,2174

Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn’t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn’t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back’s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can’t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let’s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I’m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown.

Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy – after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world’s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren’t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is ‘fracking’, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, “Fracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.” But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada’s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. “We haven’t seen the end of this yet,” says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. “CO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.” 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven’t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won’t change. “What worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,” he adds. “It will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.” Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable – which means that when we have used them up, there simply won’t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada’s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better – and we will have to.   The sound of ice I’m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn’t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship’s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the ‘northwest passage’, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn’t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship’s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It’s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there.

Stephen Samuel Stanley – ship’s doctor, HMS Erebus   In New Zealand   Working in India Get to know India and work as a volunteer Teaching young children in an orphanage in Jaipur Building and repairing schools in Goa Helping stray dogs in Ranchi For more information contact Mrs Lal. (a.lal@vii.com) My name is Emma De Santis. I’m from Germany and I’m 18 years old. I took part in a project at an orphanage in Jaipur last year. My English isn’t bad and I used to work as a babysitter for our neighbours’ kids. I could choose to work from four weeks to ten months. I decided to stay for eight weeks. Before I went to India, I had to get all the important papers. I also knew that I would have to pay the organization almost €2,000. The flight was not included. So I decided to work in a supermarket to earn the money. When I got the contract for the project in India, I booked my flight and I was ready to go. When I arrived in Jaipur, I was very tired from the journey and the time difference. The heat, the noise and the smells made it even worse. But I still remember a cow lying in front of the phone shop. During the orientation days I met other volunteers from different countries, which was great. After that I met my host family. They were very friendly people. However, I was homesick during the first days, and I had some problems with the food. It was so spicy. At the time I thought, “If I don’t feel better soon, I’ll have to quit.” But I got over it quickly. My job was great but challenging too. The working conditions were OK. I was teaching 10-year-old girls English and organizing some free-time activities for the younger ones. The staff were very helpful. They all spoke English, which made things a little easier. I quickly found out that things are different in India. Most people’s attitude in India is “Whatever happens, happens.” And usually that’s OK for everyone. Wherever I went, people were smiling at me. But they didn’t just show interest in me, many of them actually stared at me. But you learn to ignore it. I can really recommend taking part in a project like this. I met wonderful people, made new friends and learned a lot about myself. If you go to India, you’ll never forget it.",,2578

The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn’t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship’s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the ‘northwest passage’, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn’t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship’s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It’s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn’t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we’d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn’t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn’t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back’s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can’t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let’s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I’m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown. Stephen Samuel Stanley – ship’s doctor, HMS Erebus   In New Zealand   Working in India Get to know India and work as a volunteer Teaching young children in an orphanage in Jaipur Building and repairing schools in Goa Helping stray dogs in Ranchi For more information contact Mrs Lal. (a.lal@vii.com) My name is Emma De Santis. I’m from Germany and I’m 18 years old. I took part in a project at an orphanage in Jaipur last year. My English isn’t bad and I used to work as a babysitter for our neighbours’ kids. I could choose to work from four weeks to ten months. I decided to stay for eight weeks. Before I went to India, I had to get all the important papers. I also knew that I would have to pay the organization almost €2,000. The flight was not included. So I decided to work in a supermarket to earn the money. When I got the contract for the project in India, I booked my flight and I was ready to go. When I arrived in Jaipur, I was very tired from the journey and the time difference. The heat, the noise and the smells made it even worse. But I still remember a cow lying in front of the phone shop. During the orientation days I met other volunteers from different countries, which was great. After that I met my host family. They were very friendly people. However, I was homesick during the first days, and I had some problems with the food. It was so spicy. At the time I thought, “If I don’t feel better soon, I’ll have to quit.” But I got over it quickly. My job was great but challenging too. The working conditions were OK. I was teaching 10-year-old girls English and organizing some free-time activities for the younger ones. The staff were very helpful. They all spoke English, which made things a little easier. I quickly found out that things are different in India. Most people’s attitude in India is “Whatever happens, happens.” And usually that’s OK for everyone. Wherever I went, people were smiling at me. But they didn’t just show interest in me, many of them actually stared at me. But you learn to ignore it. I can really recommend taking part in a project like this. I met wonderful people, made new friends and learned a lot about myself. If you go to India, you’ll never forget it.   ‘I have a dream’ - Martin Luther King, Jr. On April 4, 1968 the African-American minister 1 and US civil rights 2 leader Martin Luther King, Junior was shot in Memphis, Tennessee. The week after his death there were violent protests in cities across the United States. But who was this man whose death shook both a nation and also people around the rest of the world? King was born in the American South, in Atlanta, Georgia, on January 15, 1929. He grew up in a religious family. His father was a Baptist pastor and his mother was a church organist. At that time the people in the American South were segregated 3 . Laws made sure that in the Southern states African-American people did not have the same rights as whites. They had to go to different schools and eat in different restaurants. They weren’t allowed to work with white people. African Americans had to sit at the back of buses and give up their seats to white people. King never wanted to accept this segregation. When he was little, his best friend was a white boy. King, however, had to go to a school for African Americans, while his friend went to a school for whites. So King lost his friend. Over the years King realized how unfair his family and neighbors were treated. He wanted to fight for the civil rights of African Americans. At the age of 18 King decided to become a minister. He felt that the church could give him the best chance to help people and society. He finished college in 1951. He got married to his girlfriend Coretta Scott in 1953, and together they had four children. A year later he became pastor of a Baptist church in Montgomery, Alabama. Protests against racial segregation began in 1955. African-American Rosa Parks hadn’t wanted to give up her bus seat to white people in the city of Montgomery. Rosa Parks was arrested. King started a campaign 4 . For 381 days people didn’t use the city’s public transportation. The campaign was led by Martin Luther King, Jr. During this time his house was bombed and he was arrested too. In the end racial segregation on all Montgomery public transportation was made illegal 5 . It was the first victory 6 for the Civil Rights Movement and it made King a very famous person. In 1957 King and other civil rights activists founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). They wanted to use non-violent protests to achieve 7 civil rights reform. King was influenced by Mahatma Gandhi and his successful non-violent protest against the British Empire in the 1940s. The SCLC started a campaign against racial segregation in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963. Everything was peaceful until the police used water cannons and police dogs against the protesters, even against children. When this was shown on national TV, many white Americans were shocked. The Birmingham campaign was successful and African Americans now had more access 8 to public places. ‘White Only’ and ‘Black Only’ signs were removed from restrooms 9 , for example. Early in the Birmingham campaign, King had been arrested again. In his cell he realized that freedom for African-American people would be a long and hard struggle 10 . Later that year King helped organize the March on Washington on August 28, 1963. Its goal was to protest against the way African Americans were treated in Southern states. The protesters wanted an end to racial segregation in schools and at work. They also wanted to protect workers from police brutality. More than 250,000 people joined the march. At the time it was the largest meeting of protesters in the history of Washington, D.C. During this event King gave his most famous speech – ‘I have a dream’. It became one of the greatest American speeches. Soon after, civil rights became the most important goal for black and white reformers in the United States. Most of the civil rights became law in 1964 and 1965. King got the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 for his role in the Civil Rights Movement. He was also named ‘Person of the Year’ by Time magazine. In March 1968 King went to Memphis, Tennessee. He wanted to support African-American workers there who were on strike 11 against bad working conditions. On April 4, 1968 he was shot. James Earl Ray, a white escaped convict 12 , was arrested and was sentenced 13 to 99 years in prison. Since 1983 the third Monday in January has become a national holiday 14 in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. The house where King was born and his grave in Atlanta are national monuments. Streets in towns and cities all over the United States have been named after him. King was the leader of the Civil Rights Movement for almost 13 years. During that time African Americans made a lot of progress on the way towards equality 15 in America. However, many black Americans still experience racial discrimination today. King is known as one of the greatest non-violent leaders in world history. ___ 1 minister [ˈmɪnɪstə] − Pfarrer, Pfarrerin ; 2 civil rights [ˌsɪvl ˈraɪts] − Bürgerrechte ; 3 segregated [ˈsegrɪgeɪtɪd] − getrennt (nach Hautfarbe) ; 4 campaign [kӕˈpeɪn] − Kampagne, Aktion ; 5 illegal [ɪˈli:gl] − illegal, gesetzeswidrig ; 6 victory [ˈvɪktri] − Sieg ; 7 to achieve [əˈt∫i:v] − erreichen ; 8 access [ˈӕkses] − Zugang, Zutritt ; 9 restroom [ˈrestˌrʊm] − Toilette ; 10 struggle [ˈstrʌgl] − Kampf ; 11 to be on strike [ɒn ˈstraɪk] − streiken ; 12 escaped convict [ɪˌskeɪpd ˈkɒnvɪkt] − flüchtiger Sträfling ; 13 to sentence [ˈsentəns] − verurteilen ; 14 national holiday [ˌnӕ∫nl ˈhɒlədeɪ] − (nationaler) Feiertag ; 15 equality [ɪˈkwɒləti] − Gleichheit",,3535
167,5KgxQUShvpd7UZ4GDJKSYt,eng,"Clara’s letter: Find out …   about their problem.    We can do even better – by Lindsay Fern (21/1/2017) 1. Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy – after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world’s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren’t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is ‘fracking’, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, “Fracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.” But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada’s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. “We haven’t seen the end of this yet,” says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. “CO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.” 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven’t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won’t change. “What worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,” he adds. “It will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.” Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable – which means that when we have used them up, there simply won’t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada’s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better – and we will have to.   The sound of ice I’m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time.

He didn’t tell me. Clara ( online ) 15th June 2021, 19:17 Hi Linda, I don’t know what to do. I’m 17 and my boyfriend, Danny, is 19. Danny is the coolest guy in the world – and he’s so cute. We’ve been together since last April. I still go to school in Christchurch, but Danny left school two months ago. I thought he was only looking for a job in Christchurch. Then last week, while we were walking to the cinema, he told me that he got a job as an apprentice chef at a hotel in Wellington. He told me after he had already accepted the job. I was so upset! Danny said that there were no jobs here and he really needed one. We could video chat every day and he would come back to Christchurch whenever he could. But it takes a whole day to get to Wellington by train and ferry. That’s too far! I really love Danny and I don’t want to lose him. We belong together! I’m thinking about leaving school and living with him in Wellington. Of course, my parents don’t understand. We had a big argument and haven’t really made up since. They just told me to concentrate on school. Please help me. I really need some advice. Clara RE: He didn’t tell me. Linda ( online ) 16th June 2021, 8:55 Hello Clara, I understand how you feel. Danny means everything to you. You want to spend every minute with him. Now Danny made an important decision without discussing it with you first. That hurts, doesn’t it? Maybe it’s time to talk about what each of you really wants. Ask yourself: What do you want? What are you worried about? Is it really only because Wellington is so far away, or don’t you trust your boyfriend? Are you afraid that he will cheat on you? How would you feel about breaking up? Whatever you do, don’t make decisions now that you may not be happy about later. If you want to stay together, you could stay with Danny during the school holidays for a start. That might be OK for your parents. You could still move in with him later, after you’ve finished school. Good luck! Linda",,3912

Only if we’re racists."" Looking back, I regret taking the test. Not because it confirmed the ancestry I could have guessed, nor even for the serious privacy concerns raised by giving my genetic code to a company. What I regret is the ease with which I accepted the racist implications underlying the test: a desire to understand who I am through DNA. In using DNA ancestry tests, we reduce the culture and lived experience that have long defined ethnicity to a biological, racial signifier that is neither especially relevant nor particularly accurate. By joining in, I inadvertently bought into the dangerous notion that who we are lies fundamentally in our blood. There’s no putting the genie of DNA testing back in the bottle. But instead of allowing it to cement racialized ways of thinking, we can use these tests to highlight how meaningless genetic ancestry is compared with the many other factors that shape our experience of ourselves and our communities. That’s exactly what happened in 2018, when Sen. Elizabeth Warren released a DNA test that indicated distant Native American ancestry. In many ways Warren was just using the same flawed, racist logic that I and all other DNA testers followed. Native American leaders rightly pushed back at the time, but the rest of us should, too, when people put undue weight on the findings of these kits.

Even when groups have claimed common descent from mythological figures, as Han Chinese do, “blood relations” have remained a smaller and unverifiable component of peoplehood. This more capacious notion of belonging is how heritage is lived day to day for most people. I didn’t need a DNA test to identify as a Jew of European ancestry. I already knew that from my family and my culture: from my religion (Judaism), the language of my grandparents (Yiddish), the food I grew up with (noodle kugel, an almost sickly sweet casserole) and the stories of my great-grandparents, fleeing pogroms and learning of the murder of their siblings in the Holocaust. And yet, no matter how strong it was, this sense of cultural heritage didn’t feel like enough for me. In a society that determines so much based on blood ‒ money, connections, assumptions about character ‒ culture by itself felt like an unreliable narrator of my identity. And I wasn’t alone: More than 26 million people are estimated to have taken genealogical DNA tests. Why? The answer goes back to the 18th and 19th centuries, when European colonialism and the slave trade birthed the modern concept of race. As societies were built and genocides committed on the basis of racial hierarchy, it became imperative for racists to prove the biological existence of race. And so race “science” emerged, seeking to dislodge cultural heritage as the prime difference between groups of people. “Aryan” became synonymous with “German,” excluding the many Jewish and Slavic speakers of the language. Graduates of southern Africa’s missionary academies faced a colonial society that saw them as black first, Christian second. While the days of measuring foreheads and skulls are (largely) behind us, race science got a new lease on life when, in the 1950s, scientists discovered the molecular structure of DNA. By the 1980s DNA testing could reliably prove paternity, and by the late 1990s, the first direct-to-consumer genealogical DNA tests were brought to market.

193,3MiM4MPsNLq8b2Mo6W8fcU,eng,"In recent years, the US has seen growing political interest among teenagers and young adults. Imagine you wanted to tell readers of Yes! Online Magazine about how young Germans feel by posting a comment in the online paper’s comment section. Use the information provided in the article Deutschlands Jugend - politisch wie nie to explain how young German voters are changing the political landscape. Deutschlands Jugend – politisch wie nie? Am Abend des 26. Mai konnte jeder für einen kurzen Moment erahnen, was es bedeutet, wenn fast 20 Millionen Menschen ihre Stimme erheben. Der Abend der Europawahl zeigte: Junge Menschen interessieren sich für die Welt um sie herum – und sie sind laut. Die Wahlbeteiligung stieg, Altparteien mussten mit Schrecken beobachten, wie ihre Zustimmungswerte fielen, die Klimapartei Bündnis 90/Die Grünen triumphierte: alles ein Verdienst der jungen Wähler. Keine andere Partei schnitt in Deutschland so gut bei unter 30-Jährigen ab wie die Grünen. Schon jetzt wird deshalb in Deutschland von einer neuen, politisierten Generation gesprochen. Vergleichbar nur mit den jungen Wilden der 1968er Jahre, die in Deutschland Werte der Nachkriegszeit in Frage stellten. Ähnlich wie vor über 50 Jahren könnte auch diese Klima-Generation den althergebrachten Politikbetrieb aufmischen, neue Werte schaffen, eine eigene Agenda setzen. […] Dabei zeigt sich nur, was sich schon lange angebahnt hat. Schon die „Shell Jugendstudie“ hielt 2015 fest, dass im Vergleich zu 2002 statt 30 Prozent nun bereits 41 Prozent der Jugendlichen erklärten, politisch interessiert zu sein. […] Die jungen Engagierten haben einen mächtigen Verbündeten: die sozialen Netzwerke. […] Für die Politikwissenschaftlerin und Gründerin des „Y-Politik“-Podcasts Tanja Hille ist gerade der Einfluss von Social Media Stars, die normalerweise keine politischen Inhalte kreieren, entscheidend. „In meiner Generation war es noch so, dass wir uns Informationen aktiv beschaffen mussten“, sagt die 27-Jährige. […] In der Politik ist das Erstarken der jungen Stimmen noch nicht angekommen. In den Parteien im Bundestag finden sich nur wenige Abgeordnete jüngerer Jahrgänge. Und auch im Umgang mit neuen Kräften wie Influencern zeigen sich große Parteien noch ungelenk. […] Die junge CDU-Politikerin Diana Kinnert sagt […]: Das Konzept „Partei ist unattraktiv auf hundert verschiedenen Ebenen. Junge Menschen sind nicht unpolitischer geworden; sie engagieren sich nur anders.“ Auch YouTuberin Diana zur Löwen kritisiert vor allem die Abwehrhaltung der Parteien. „Ich glaube, was viele satt haben, sind Politiker ohne Herzblut. Wir wollen wieder Leidenschaft sehen, und auch mal Politiker, die uns auf Instagram mitnehmen in ihren Alltag.“ ___ Lisa Hänel, Deutsche Welle website, 2019    Three quotes about society The minute we become an integrated whole, we look through the same eyes and we see a whole different world together. ___ Azizah Al-Hibri, American philosopher and legal scholar Peace is not unity in similarity but unity in diversity, in the comparison and conciliation of differences. ___ Mikhail Gorbachev, former Russian president Unlike a drop of water which loses its identity when it joins the ocean, man does not lose his being in the society in which he lives.

196,3R6goWUWJ3y9giGmqY23Om,eng,"Your English friend has emailed you that he/she must talk about the consequences of Brexit on the UK’s international relations in his/her Citizenship course at school and asks you how to describe Germany’s attitude to the topic. In an email to your friend, outline Maas’ attitude to the future relationship between the EU and the UK as pointed out in his letter to the citizens of the UK. Wir wollen die engstmögliche Partnerschaft Liebe Briten, Keep calm and carry on – höre ich einige von Euch murmeln. Aber das fällt uns nicht leicht. Für solch britische Gelassenheit bleibt Ihr zuständig – Brexit hin oder her. Also, in aller deutschen Direktheit: Dass Ihr geht, tut weh. Nicht nur, weil die Europäische Union 66 Millionen Bürgerinnen und Bürger verliert und eine ihrer stärksten Volkswirtschaften. Global Britain, das wart Ihr schon immer. Der EU hat das gutgetan. Euer Pragmatismus, Eure Toleranz, Euer Humor, ja selbst Euer Beharren auf manch britischem Sonderweg – all das wird uns schmerzhaft fehlen, wenn Ihr in wenigen Tagen die Europäische Union verlasst. Klar haben wir es nicht immer leicht gehabt miteinander, besonders seit dem Brexit-Referendum. Quälende Nachtsitzungen in Brüssel, schier endlose Parlamentsdebatten in Westminster, die immer verzweifelteren Oordeeeer-Rufe Eures Mister Speaker – viel zu lange klang der Brexit nach dem Punkrock-Hit meiner Jugend: Should I Stay or Should I Go? […] Natürlich werden sich Dinge ändern in unserem Verhältnis. Es wird zwangsläufig loser, unverbindlicher als innerhalb der EU. Aber wie lose es wird, das liegt in unserer Hand. Und für Deutschland kann ich sagen: Wir wollen die engstmögliche Partnerschaft mit Großbritannien, auch morgen. Schließlich teilen wir nicht nur diesen Kontinent, sondern dieselben europäischen Werte, die sich gegen immer größere Widerstände behaupten müssen in dieser Welt. Und egal ob beim Klimaschutz, bei den Menschenrechten, bei Zukunftstechnologien oder in Fragen europäischer Sicherheit – wir spielen weiter im gleichen Team! […] Dieser Tage hört man gelegentlich, in den jetzt anstehenden Verhandlungen müsse Großbritannien abgestraft werden für seinen Austritt aus der Europäischen Union. Ich hielte das für einen großen Fehler. Wollten wir denjenigen schaden, die sich abwenden, dann würden wir am Ende weder die Briten bekehren, noch die restlichen Europäer überzeugen. Politisch klug und im besten britischen Sinn fair ist dagegen, die Verhandlungen so zu führen, dass sie der Europäischen Union nicht schaden. […] Was wir brauchen, sind neue, inklusive Formen der Zusammenarbeit – gerade in der Außen- und Sicherheitspolitik. Vor einigen Monaten habe ich deshalb einen Europäischen Sicherheitsrat vorgeschlagen, um uns dort über die strategischen Fragen europäischer Sicherheit abzustimmen. Um in Krisen schneller zu handeln. Und nicht zuletzt, um Großbritannien und die Europäische Union über den Brexit hinaus zusammenzuhalten. Mit Frankreich arbeiten wir daran, diese Idee so schnell wie möglich zu konkretisieren. Denn so legen wir ein Fundament für unser künftiges Verhältnis. „ You say Goodbye, I say Hello “, singen die Beatles in ihrem Song. Das Goodbye haben wir gut geregelt. Und sollte es sich doch irgendwann als ein „Auf Wiedersehen“ herausstellen: Für Euch ist immer Platz – an unserem Tisch in Brüssel und in unseren Herzen. Machen wir uns jetzt also ans Hello, an unsere Zukunft. Getrennt, aber gemeinsam.

Man’s life is independent. He is born not for the development of the society alone, but for the development of his self. ___ B. R. Ambedkar, former Indian Minister of Law and Justice   The House on Mango Street My name In English my name means hope. In Spanish it means too many letters. It means sadness, it means waiting. It is like the number nine. A muddy color. It is the Mexican records my father plays on Sunday mornings when he is shaving, songs like sobbing. It was my great-grandmother’s name and now it is mine. She was a horse woman too, born like me in the Chinese year of the horse – which is supposed 1 to be bad luck if you’re born female – but I think this is a Chinese lie because the Chinese, like the Mexicans, don’t like their women strong. My great-grandmother. I would’ve liked to have known her, a wild horse of a woman, so wild she wouldn’t marry. Until my great-grandfather threw a sack over her head and carried her off. Just like that, as if she were a fancy chandelier 2 . That’s the way he did it. And the story goes she never forgave him. She looked out the window her whole life, the way so many women sit their sadness on an elbow. I wonder if she made the best with what she got or was she sorry because she couldn’t be all the things she wanted to be. Esperanza. I have inherited her name, but I don’t want to inherit her place by the window. At school they say my name funny as if the syllables were made out of tin and hurt the roof of your mouth. But in Spanish my name is made out of a softer something, like silver, not quite as thick as my sister’s name – Magdalena – which is uglier than mine. Magdalena who at least can come home and become Nenny. But I am always Esperanza. I would like to baptize 3 myself under a new name, a name more like the real me, the one nobody sees.

The Titanic disaster The Belfast News Wednesday, 17th April 1912 TWO DAYS AFTER – MORE FACTS The giant ship Titanic, which was built here in Belfast’s shipyard, hit an iceberg on 14th April, shortly before midnight. Water filled the ship until it sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD’S LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship’s builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. LOCAL MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland. The ship’s doctor, Dr John Simpson, 37, was born in Belfast. His mother was optimistic when a letter from him arrived at her home yesterday. However, we have found out that he posted the letter during the ship’s last stop. We now know that Dr Simpson did not survive. DOG SAVES LIVES Some were lucky and the ships which came to save the passengers of the Titanic found their lifeboat. According to a passenger, one of the dogs on board saved the lives of the people in one lifeboat. A ship only found this lifeboat in the dark night and the foggy weather because they heard the dog when it barked. HOW COULD IT HAPPEN? After the sinking of the Titanic a number of questions still need answers. Why did no one see the iceberg? Why did the ship break? Why were there only 20 lifeboats for 2,200 people on board? Why did lifeboats leave the ship when they were not yet full? And how can we make sure that an accident like this will never happen again? About 700 people survived the accident. Some ships today have over 6,500 passengers and crew. After the Titanic’s accident there were laws that ships must have one lifeboat place for every person on board. Dr Simpson’s last letter to his mother is now in the Belfast Titanic museum.   A deadly silence 1. My name is Jonas Fox and I’m twelve years old. I work in the mines and my job is to sit near a door in the tunnel every day. I must open the door when the coal arrives. Then, after it’s gone, I quickly close the door again. Every day I sit in the dark, but I’m never scared. That’s because my friend Billy is always there with me. Billy sings all day long. He’s yellow with little black eyes which look like they are made of glass. Billy is a canary, you see? It’s never boring with Billy around. I would love to sing too, but I can’t even talk. 2. Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine killed 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there’s gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine. One day Bart started to cough and he never stopped coughing after that. Then one night my brother coughed so badly that he died. That was when I stopped talking. I don’t know why, really. I still had words in my head and I opened my mouth, but I couldn’t speak. The men in the mine started to call me ‘Silent Jonas’ after that. They probably thought I was a bit strange. 4. The day when things got really bad started like any other. Billy was singing like he always did. I heard the people in the tunnels and the noise of the coal trucks. I opened the door and I felt a cold wind in the tunnel. I closed the door again. Billy stopped singing. For a moment I didn’t understand. But then, suddenly, I did: There was gas in the mine! And it could explode any second. I didn’t have time to run down the tunnel to warn the men. If only I could talk, if only I could shout! 5. I knew I had to warn everyone in the mine. So I opened my mouth and tried to say it: “Gas.” But there was no sound. Nothing came out. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth again. Nothing. I panicked. We could die in here – I had to speak! I tried again. This time the sound was quiet, but I made a sound. At last! I opened the door and shouted, “Gas. Gas. GAS!” A moment later I heard the sound of the miners’ boots in the tunnels. I took Billy’s cage and ran too. 6. I ran through the tunnel as fast as I could. But my head hurt and I couldn’t breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn’t tell where it was coming from. “Come on, boy!” it said. Somebody picked me up. I turned around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy’s cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn’t just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, “Who warned us?” “Me!” I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. “Silent Jonas found his voice!” a miner shouted. But how could I feel happy? My friend Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small ‘Tweet’. Billy was alive! I opened the cage … There were canaries in mines until 1987. Today miners use machines to find out if there is gas in the mine.   The Norman conquest The old king of England, Edward, died in 1066. He had no children and both his Anglo-Saxon brother-in-law, Harold, and his French cousin, William, Duke of Normandy, wanted to be the next king of England. Harold made himself king, and William was very angry. So what did he do next? He sailed to England with his army … Harold and William fought the battle on Senlac Hill, near Hastings. William’s men were knights and they were better trained. They fought on horses and were good archers. Harold’s men fought on foot and they were already tired from an earlier battle at Stamford Bridge, 200 miles away in the north of England. (Yes, they had to walk those 200 miles!) How do we know what happened during the Battle of Hastings? Well, we have the 70-metre long Bayeux Tapestry to tell us! The tapestry is like a comic and it tells the story of the battle. It tells us that Harold died when he got an arrow in his eye, but we don’t know if this really happened. William won the Battle of Hastings and he became king of England on Christmas Day 1066. Today we know him as William the Conqueror. He was a big castle fan and built lots of them in England, including part of the Tower of London. He also took land from the Anglo-Saxons and gave it to his Norman friends. Did the Normans change England? Yes, of course they did! For example, they brought many new words to the English language. Words like ‘pork’ and ‘garden’ come from this time. Guess what? There are still many English people who have Norman surnames, like Archer or Darcy. Before the Normans came to England, most people didn’t even have surnames. They lived in small villages, so a first name or a nickname was often enough. ___ conquest – Eroberung ; the Anglo-Saxons – die Angelsachsen (das Volk, das schon vor 1066 in England lebte) ; brother-in-law – Schwager ; duke – Herzog ; army – Heer; Armee ; knight – Ritter ; archer – Bogenschütze; Bogenschützin ; tapestry – Wandteppich ; surname – Nachname; Familienname",,1518

Every day I sit in the dark, but I’m never scared. That’s because my friend Billy is always there with me. Billy sings all day long. He’s yellow with little black eyes which look like they are made of glass. Billy is a canary, you see? It’s never boring with Billy around. I would love to sing too, but I can’t even talk. 2. Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine killed 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there’s gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine. One day Bart started to cough and he never stopped coughing after that. Then one night my brother coughed so badly that he died. That was when I stopped talking. I don’t know why, really. I still had words in my head and I opened my mouth, but I couldn’t speak. The men in the mine started to call me ‘Silent Jonas’ after that. They probably thought I was a bit strange. 4. The day when things got really bad started like any other. Billy was singing like he always did. I heard the people in the tunnels and the noise of the coal trucks. I opened the door and I felt a cold wind in the tunnel. I closed the door again. Billy stopped singing. For a moment I didn’t understand. But then, suddenly, I did: There was gas in the mine! And it could explode any second. I didn’t have time to run down the tunnel to warn the men. If only I could talk, if only I could shout! 5. I knew I had to warn everyone in the mine. So I opened my mouth and tried to say it: “Gas.” But there was no sound. Nothing came out. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth again. Nothing. I panicked. We could die in here – I had to speak! I tried again. This time the sound was quiet, but I made a sound. At last! I opened the door and shouted, “Gas. Gas. GAS!” A moment later I heard the sound of the miners’ boots in the tunnels. I took Billy’s cage and ran too. 6. I ran through the tunnel as fast as I could. But my head hurt and I couldn’t breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn’t tell where it was coming from. “Come on, boy!” it said. Somebody picked me up. I turned around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy’s cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn’t just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, “Who warned us?” “Me!” I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. “Silent Jonas found his voice!” a miner shouted. But how could I feel happy? My friend Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small ‘Tweet’. Billy was alive! I opened the cage … There were canaries in mines until 1987. Today miners use machines to find out if there is gas in the mine.   The Norman conquest The old king of England, Edward, died in 1066. He had no children and both his Anglo-Saxon brother-in-law, Harold, and his French cousin, William, Duke of Normandy, wanted to be the next king of England. Harold made himself king, and William was very angry. So what did he do next? He sailed to England with his army … Harold and William fought the battle on Senlac Hill, near Hastings. William’s men were knights and they were better trained. They fought on horses and were good archers. Harold’s men fought on foot and they were already tired from an earlier battle at Stamford Bridge, 200 miles away in the north of England. (Yes, they had to walk those 200 miles!) How do we know what happened during the Battle of Hastings? Well, we have the 70-metre long Bayeux Tapestry to tell us! The tapestry is like a comic and it tells the story of the battle. It tells us that Harold died when he got an arrow in his eye, but we don’t know if this really happened. William won the Battle of Hastings and he became king of England on Christmas Day 1066. Today we know him as William the Conqueror. He was a big castle fan and built lots of them in England, including part of the Tower of London. He also took land from the Anglo-Saxons and gave it to his Norman friends. Did the Normans change England? Yes, of course they did! For example, they brought many new words to the English language. Words like ‘pork’ and ‘garden’ come from this time. Guess what? There are still many English people who have Norman surnames, like Archer or Darcy. Before the Normans came to England, most people didn’t even have surnames. They lived in small villages, so a first name or a nickname was often enough. ___ conquest – Eroberung ; the Anglo-Saxons – die Angelsachsen (das Volk, das schon vor 1066 in England lebte) ; brother-in-law – Schwager ; duke – Herzog ; army – Heer; Armee ; knight – Ritter ; archer – Bogenschütze; Bogenschützin ; tapestry – Wandteppich ; surname – Nachname; Familienname   The RNLI: Volunteers on the coast The RNLI is the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.

The two 14-year-old boys went out too far in their kayaks and could not get back to the beach because of strong winds. They tried to get back for more than two and a half hours, then shouted for help and waved. A tourist spotted the boys and made an emergency call to the RNLI. The lifeboat crew left their station at 1:40 p.m. and got to the kayaks in only a few minutes. The RNLI crew picked up the boys and gave them blankets and hot drinks to keep them warm.

The Titanic disaster The Belfast News Wednesday, 17th April 1912 TWO DAYS AFTER – MORE FACTS The giant ship Titanic, which was built here in Belfast’s shipyard, hit an iceberg on 14th April, shortly before midnight. Water filled the ship until it sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD’S LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship’s builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. LOCAL MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland. The ship’s doctor, Dr John Simpson, 37, was born in Belfast. His mother was optimistic when a letter from him arrived at her home yesterday. However, we have found out that he posted the letter during the ship’s last stop. We now know that Dr Simpson did not survive. DOG SAVES LIVES Some were lucky and the ships which came to save the passengers of the Titanic found their lifeboat. According to a passenger, one of the dogs on board saved the lives of the people in one lifeboat. A ship only found this lifeboat in the dark night and the foggy weather because they heard the dog when it barked. HOW COULD IT HAPPEN? After the sinking of the Titanic a number of questions still need answers. Why did no one see the iceberg? Why did the ship break? Why were there only 20 lifeboats for 2,200 people on board? Why did lifeboats leave the ship when they were not yet full? And how can we make sure that an accident like this will never happen again? About 700 people survived the accident. Some ships today have over 6,500 passengers and crew. After the Titanic’s accident there were laws that ships must have one lifeboat place for every person on board.

I want to be with my friends. But I’m not. Mum and Dad sent me to stay with Aunt Susan for six long days. To a village! In the middle of nowhere. All you can see are fields, trees and some animals. There are no shops, no cafés and no buses. No skate park either! It’s so boring! How can people live here? There was a party in the village this evening. But it wasn’t fun. There was a barbecue 1 and then singing and dancing. But the music was awful. I was so bored that I turned their music off and played some hip-hop 2 instead. Everybody was mad and shouted at me. I laughed at them and left. I hate this place and I hate these people. How can birds be so loud? Some of them started singing at four in the morning! Later the church bells 3 rang 4 . Nothing happened today. Just another boring day. When can I go home? Nothing! Aunt Susan wanted me to help with the cows and in the garden, but I stayed in my room and watched films. The village boys tried to pick me up for a football game. I told them that I didn’t have my football shoes and couldn’t play. I can’t believe what happened last night. I woke up in the middle of the night because there was a loud noise in the house. I went to the kitchen and saw Aunt Susan there. She was on the phone, and she was very excited. When she saw me, she told me to come with her. Rosalie needed help. I didn’t know who Rosalie was. I was surprised when I saw that Rosalie was one of Aunt Susan’s cows. She needed help with her calf. Some other people from the village were there too. They were all very calm and knew what to do. They told me to hold the light so that the vet could see well. I could hardly look. That noise! And it smelt terrible. Yuck! 5 Then it was there. A little calf. So sweet, so clumsy. We all felt very happy. I was so tired but so excited. I got up early again. I just had to see if the calf was OK. It was. It stood next to Rosalie and drank its milk. It’s the most beautiful little cow I’ve ever seen 6 . I think I’ll ask Aunt Susan if I can come back again. I think it’s not that bad here. ___ 1 barbecue – Grillparty ; 2 hip-hop – Hip Hop (Musikrichtung) ; 3 bell – die Glocke ; 4 ring – läuten ; 5 yuck – igitt 6 the most beautiful cow I’ve ever seen – die schönste Kuh, die ich je gesehen habe",,1538

London is the place for me! Old woman I don’t think so. It’s an awful place. (Dora looks down the road. There is the sound of a bus.) Dora Here’s my bus. Oh … and my name’s Dora White.

I want to be with my friends. But I’m not. Mum and Dad sent me to stay with Aunt Susan for six long days. To a village! In the middle of nowhere. All you can see are fields, trees and some animals. There are no shops, no cafés and no buses. No skate park either! It’s so boring! How can people live here? There was a party in the village this evening. But it wasn’t fun. There was a barbecue 1 and then singing and dancing. But the music was awful. I was so bored that I turned their music off and played some hip-hop 2 instead. Everybody was mad and shouted at me.

Nothing happened today. Just another boring day. When can I go home? Nothing! Aunt Susan wanted me to help with the cows and in the garden, but I stayed in my room and watched films.

When she saw me, she told me to come with her. Rosalie needed help. I didn’t know who Rosalie was. I was surprised when I saw that Rosalie was one of Aunt Susan’s cows. She needed help with her calf. Some other people from the village were there too. They were all very calm and knew what to do. They told me to hold the light so that the vet could see well. I could hardly look. That noise! And it smelt terrible. Yuck! 5 Then it was there. A little calf. So sweet, so clumsy. We all felt very happy. I was so tired but so excited. I got up early again. I just had to see if the calf was OK. It was. It stood next to Rosalie and drank its milk. It’s the most beautiful little cow I’ve ever seen 6 . I think I’ll ask Aunt Susan if I can come back again.

Luke and Gwen were on the bus. “Dad said we can get a takeaway pizza tonight,” said Gwen. “I love tuna pizza. What’s your favourite pizza, Luke?” Luke didn’t answer. “Did you hear me?” asked Gwen. “Sorry. I’m playing this game on my phone,” said Luke. “I have a really high score. Look!” “I can’t see that,” said Gwen. “Sorry. I forgot you have a problem with your eyes,” said Luke. “You forgot Dave’s birthday. You forgot your homework. You forget everything,” said Gwen. “No, I don’t,” said Luke. He looked out of the window. “Oh no! This is my stop. I forgot where we are! Bye Gwen, see you tomorrow.” Luke rushed down the stairs and got off the bus. He wanted to finish his game. He put his hand in his pocket, but his phone wasn’t there! “Oh no, I must have forgotten it on the bus!” He looked up. But the bus wasn’t there any more. Luke went home and phoned the bus company. They wanted to help but first they needed a special number from his phone – and he didn’t know the number! Luke didn’t enjoy his dinner at all that night. Why wasn’t he more careful with his phone? Suddenly the doorbell rang. “Gwen’s here!” shouted Luke’s mum from the hall. Luke went to the door. Gwen and her dad were there. “I heard something fall on the floor when you got off the bus,” said Gwen. “I asked a woman to see what it was.” Gwen gave Luke his phone. “Wow!” said Luke. “Today is my lucky day! Thanks, Gwen.” “That’s what friends are for!” said Gwen. “Come on, Gwen. Let’s get that pizza!” said Gwen’s dad. Luke put his phone in his pocket. It really was his lucky day.

I’m Robert, the leader for today’s walk. Can Shruti, Alejandro, Daniel and Maria come with me?” Four students got up and followed Robert. “We’re going to go hiking in the forest,” said Robert. “You should all have long trousers, good shoes, a hat and a bottle of water. Any questions?” “What about lunch?” asked Alejandro. “There’s a packed lunch with sandwiches, fruit and a cake,” answered Robert. “Do I need my GPS 1 map?” asked Maria. “It’s the New Forest, not the Amazon jungle 2 !” said Shruti. “I’ve got a map, but you can take yours too,” said Robert. Maria smiled. 12:34 p.m.: In the forest “When is lunch?” asked Shruti. “We’re going to stop at the picnic spot 3 ,” said Robert. “How far is that?” asked Shruti. “It’s on my map,” said Robert. He looked in his bag as 4 he walked. Suddenly Robert tripped. He fell down a bank and into a small river. His bag opened, and all the sandwiches went into the river. The students ran down to him. “Are you OK?” asked Alejandro. “It’s my ankle,” said Robert. “I think it’s broken.” Maria and Daniel pulled Robert out of the river. Alejandro held his leg as they moved him. Then Shruti took out her phone. “What are we going to do? We don’t know where we are, and there’s no signal!” she said. “I know first aid 5 . I can look after Robert until we get help,” said Alejandro. “And I can use my GPS to find out where we are,” said Maria. Alejandro looked at Robert’s ankle and Daniel gave him some water. Shruti didn’t know what to do. She felt bad. “Come here, Shruti. You can help me,” said Maria. “We need someone to run and get help, and you can run fast.” “Where should I go?” Shruti asked excitedly. “Look at my GPS,” said Maria. “There’s a hill about two miles from here. You can get a signal at the top of it. Run there and call the emergency services.” “Good luck, Shruti!” said Alejandro as Shruti started to run. 2:00 p.m.: In the forest “Where’s Shruti? I hope she’s OK,” said Alejandro. “Robert needs help soon.” Robert was in a lot of pain 6 . Suddenly they heard a noise. “It’s a helicopter!” said Maria. The helicopter landed and soon Shruti arrived with two paramedics. “Well done, Shruti!” said Alejandro. “Thank you. And thank you, Maria, for knowing where to go,” Shruti said. The paramedics gave Robert a warm blanket, a drink and a tablet. “Well done, everyone!” said Robert. “You’ve shown what you can do when you work together. You’ve been an amazing team.” ___ 1 GPS – GPS (satellitengesteuertes weltweites Standortsystem) ; 2 jungle – der Dschungel ; 3 picnic spot – der Picknickplatz ; 4 as – während, als ; 5 first aid – die Erste Hilfe ; 6 pain – der Schmerz",,2510

When she saw me, she told me to come with her. Rosalie needed help. I didn’t know who Rosalie was. I was surprised when I saw that Rosalie was one of Aunt Susan’s cows. She needed help with her calf. Some other people from the village were there too. They were all very calm and knew what to do. They told me to hold the light so that the vet could see well. I could hardly look. That noise! And it smelt terrible. Yuck! 5 Then it was there. A little calf. So sweet, so clumsy. We all felt very happy. I was so tired but so excited. I got up early again. I just had to see if the calf was OK. It was. It stood next to Rosalie and drank its milk. It’s the most beautiful little cow I’ve ever seen 6 . I think I’ll ask Aunt Susan if I can come back again. I think it’s not that bad here. ___ 1 barbecue – Grillparty ; 2 hip-hop – Hip Hop (Musikrichtung) ; 3 bell – die Glocke ; 4 ring – läuten ; 5 yuck – igitt 6 the most beautiful cow I’ve ever seen – die schönste Kuh, die ich je gesehen habe   A walk in the New Forest 9:30 a.m.: New Forest International Summer Camp “Hello everyone!

Maria smiled. 12:34 p.m.: In the forest “When is lunch?” asked Shruti. “We’re going to stop at the picnic spot 3 ,” said Robert. “How far is that?” asked Shruti. “It’s on my map,” said Robert. He looked in his bag as 4 he walked. Suddenly Robert tripped. He fell down a bank and into a small river. His bag opened, and all the sandwiches went into the river. The students ran down to him. “Are you OK?” asked Alejandro. “It’s my ankle,” said Robert. “I think it’s broken.” Maria and Daniel pulled Robert out of the river. Alejandro held his leg as they moved him. Then Shruti took out her phone. “What are we going to do? We don’t know where we are, and there’s no signal!” she said. “I know first aid 5 . I can look after Robert until we get help,” said Alejandro. “And I can use my GPS to find out where we are,” said Maria. Alejandro looked at Robert’s ankle and Daniel gave him some water. Shruti didn’t know what to do. She felt bad. “Come here, Shruti. You can help me,” said Maria. “We need someone to run and get help, and you can run fast.” “Where should I go?” Shruti asked excitedly. “Look at my GPS,” said Maria. “There’s a hill about two miles from here. You can get a signal at the top of it. Run there and call the emergency services.” “Good luck, Shruti!” said Alejandro as Shruti started to run. 2:00 p.m.: In the forest “Where’s Shruti? I hope she’s OK,” said Alejandro. “Robert needs help soon.” Robert was in a lot of pain 6 . Suddenly they heard a noise. “It’s a helicopter!” said Maria.

What was it like on the lifeboat?    The Titanic disaster The Belfast News Wednesday, 17th April 1912 TWO DAYS AFTER – MORE FACTS The giant ship Titanic, which was built here in Belfast’s shipyard, hit an iceberg on 14th April, shortly before midnight. Water filled the ship until it sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD’S LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship’s builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. LOCAL MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland. The ship’s doctor, Dr John Simpson, 37, was born in Belfast. His mother was optimistic when a letter from him arrived at her home yesterday.

Dr Simpson’s last letter to his mother is now in the Belfast Titanic museum.   A deadly silence 1. My name is Jonas Fox and I’m twelve years old. I work in the mines and my job is to sit near a door in the tunnel every day. I must open the door when the coal arrives. Then, after it’s gone, I quickly close the door again. Every day I sit in the dark, but I’m never scared. That’s because my friend Billy is always there with me. Billy sings all day long. He’s yellow with little black eyes which look like they are made of glass. Billy is a canary, you see? It’s never boring with Billy around. I would love to sing too, but I can’t even talk. 2. Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine killed 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there’s gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine. One day Bart started to cough and he never stopped coughing after that. Then one night my brother coughed so badly that he died. That was when I stopped talking. I don’t know why, really. I still had words in my head and I opened my mouth, but I couldn’t speak. The men in the mine started to call me ‘Silent Jonas’ after that. They probably thought I was a bit strange. 4. The day when things got really bad started like any other. Billy was singing like he always did. I heard the people in the tunnels and the noise of the coal trucks. I opened the door and I felt a cold wind in the tunnel. I closed the door again. Billy stopped singing. For a moment I didn’t understand. But then, suddenly, I did: There was gas in the mine! And it could explode any second. I didn’t have time to run down the tunnel to warn the men. If only I could talk, if only I could shout! 5. I knew I had to warn everyone in the mine. So I opened my mouth and tried to say it: “Gas.” But there was no sound. Nothing came out. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth again. Nothing. I panicked. We could die in here – I had to speak! I tried again. This time the sound was quiet, but I made a sound. At last! I opened the door and shouted, “Gas. Gas. GAS!” A moment later I heard the sound of the miners’ boots in the tunnels. I took Billy’s cage and ran too. 6. I ran through the tunnel as fast as I could. But my head hurt and I couldn’t breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn’t tell where it was coming from. “Come on, boy!” it said. Somebody picked me up. I turned around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy’s cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn’t just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, “Who warned us?” “Me!” I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. “Silent Jonas found his voice!” a miner shouted. But how could I feel happy? My friend Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small ‘Tweet’. Billy was alive! I opened the cage … There were canaries in mines until 1987. Today miners use machines to find out if there is gas in the mine.",,1165

Man’s life is independent. He is born not for the development of the society alone, but for the development of his self. ___ B. R. Ambedkar, former Indian Minister of Law and Justice   The House on Mango Street My name In English my name means hope. In Spanish it means too many letters. It means sadness, it means waiting. It is like the number nine. A muddy color. It is the Mexican records my father plays on Sunday mornings when he is shaving, songs like sobbing. It was my great-grandmother’s name and now it is mine. She was a horse woman too, born like me in the Chinese year of the horse – which is supposed 1 to be bad luck if you’re born female – but I think this is a Chinese lie because the Chinese, like the Mexicans, don’t like their women strong. My great-grandmother. I would’ve liked to have known her, a wild horse of a woman, so wild she wouldn’t marry. Until my great-grandfather threw a sack over her head and carried her off. Just like that, as if she were a fancy chandelier 2 . That’s the way he did it. And the story goes she never forgave him. She looked out the window her whole life, the way so many women sit their sadness on an elbow. I wonder if she made the best with what she got or was she sorry because she couldn’t be all the things she wanted to be. Esperanza. I have inherited her name, but I don’t want to inherit her place by the window. At school they say my name funny as if the syllables were made out of tin and hurt the roof of your mouth. But in Spanish my name is made out of a softer something, like silver, not quite as thick as my sister’s name – Magdalena – which is uglier than mine. Magdalena who at least can come home and become Nenny. But I am always Esperanza. I would like to baptize 3 myself under a new name, a name more like the real me, the one nobody sees.

Police officer OK, now … let’s see what the problem is … It’s … raccoons? Yes, … racoons!   A cat’s life Henry here, nice to meet you. I live with Lilly Harper, her brother Jack and their mum and dad in a nice house. I like my house. There are a lot of places where I can sleep. My favourite place is my big bed. Lilly says it’s her bed, but it isn’t her bed. It’s MY bed. The family also like my sofa in the living room in the evening. The Harpers feed me and clean the litter tray for me every day. I get very upset when 1 they forget! But they’re not bad. When I want to play, they play with me and stroke 2 me. That’s “purr-fect” 3 . During the day I often sleep because I must be fit for the night. It’s nearly dark. Garden time! I like to watch birds there. So I meow 4 loudly, and Lilly opens the door. She’s good at opening doors for me. Uh-oh, there’s the neighbour’s dog. He’s in my garden again! I get angry, very angry. I growl 5 and make myself VERY BIG. We fight, and the fur flies 6 . He runs away. I always win! Silly dog! Ohh, what’s this? I can smell fish from across the road 7 . I love it! I find a piece of fish near the bins. The extra food is yummy! And it’s always time for food. Food … good idea. It’s 5:30 in the morning, and I’m tired and hungry. I meow loudly until one of the Harpers opens the door. They feed me and stroke me again. Where can I sleep today? ___ 1 when – wenn, falls ; 2 to stroke – streicheln ; 3 purr-fect – Wortspiel: to purr (schnurren), perfect (perfekt) ; 4 to meow – miauen ; 5 to growl – knurren ; 6 the fur flies – die Fetzen fliegen ; 7 road – die Straße",,647

Since I never saw my father or mother and never saw a resemblance between the two (because their days were long before the days of the photographs), my first fantasies about how they were unreasonably stemmed from their headstones. The shape of the letters on my father's headstones gave me a strange idea that he was a square, stocky, dark man with curly black hair.

In fact, I loved Edinburgh so much that I stayed after university. Initially I lived and worked in the city, but after meeting my husband (who is a real Scot!) we moved to the nearby countryside. I now work from home as I have my own business, but I love going to the city on weekends with my mini.

It grins or sneers to show it is excited or afraid. It presses its lips together if it wants to impress another chimp. When it plays, a chimp generally has an open smile with its top teeth covered. Apart from its face, a chimp also uses body language to communicate. For example, its hair stands on end when it is excited. That reaction limited can also mean that it is afraid. When it is aggressive, it usually raises its arms or hits the ground and stares at another animal. A chimp normally produces more than 15 different types of call. For example, there is a special identification call that will help its family find it. When chimps play, they often make a sound similar to our laughter.

As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness of either of them (for their days were long before the days of photographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like were unreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on my father's gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man with curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription, ""also Georgiana wife of the above,"" I drew a childish conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly. To five little stone lozenges, each about a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside their grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little solar day brothers of mine—who gave up trying to get a living exceedingly early bring up in that universal struggle — I am indebted for a belief I religiously entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands in their trowsers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state of existence.

I thought it was a magical city with a very special atmosphere. It’s small enough to get around easily and not feel lost, but big enough that there’s a lot to do. So after I left school, I decided to go to university there. It was a good decision – I had a wonderful time! The locals were really friendly and after some time I even started to understand the Edinburgh accent. In fact, I loved Edinburgh so much that I stayed after university. At first I lived and worked in the city, but after I met my husband (who is a true Scotsman!) we moved to the countryside nearby. I work from home now as I ane have my own business. But I love to drive to the city at the weekend in my Mini. Last week my parents came to stay and we visited Edinburgh Castle and the Scottish National Gallery. One day we took the children to the zoo, and another day we took a boat out to Inchcolm Abbey on a nearby island. Most days we had a picnic lunch in the Princes Street Gardens.I love that there are so many different things to do in Edinburgh. This city really has become my home now.

I grabbed all my money, which was less than a dollar. Then I was ready to go. I went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad. I was walking up Carbine Street towards the clubhouse when Chris caught up with me. His eyes were shining. “Gordie! You want to see something?” “Sure.

He and his friends have got enough wine to keep them drunk for a week. I’ll put it back before then.” Chris hated alcohol – he’d already seen too much of what it can do. He was the only one of us who didn’t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they’d stolen from their father. “Have you got bullets for it?” “Nine of them – all that was left in the box. He’ll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.” “Any in it at the moment?” “No, of course not. What do you think I am?” I finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA – BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin – it was the work of an evil magician. “Wow!” I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn’t tell if he was amused or scared. “You did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!” “Shut up! Let’s go!” I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. “Man, it’s a pity you couldn’t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.” “You knew there was a bullet in it, didn’t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.” “I didn’t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad’s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.” Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to take care laugh again.

In the last couple of years a new trend has become popular in the USA: More people like to eat better quality food and live a more active life. introduction It is slowly going out of fashion to live off convenience and frozen food. A number of people shop for organic food at special supermarkets instead. In some states farmers’ markets offer a great variety of fresh vegetables and fruit from the region. “There are also dairy products, bread and meat without chemical additives at these markets. Organic food is not only much healthier but it tastes a lot better as well,” explains Emma from Boston. So how about some healthy recipes for Thanksgiving? Maybe pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes? A roast turkey breast or a turkey roulade filled with apples and cranberries is delicious too. But there’s more to a healthy lifestyle than just food. A lot of trend sports show that you can have fun, spend time with friends and stay fit at the same time. Have you found the right sport for you yet? If not, here is a suggestion: How about standup paddleboarding? If you like water, that’s the ideal kind of sport for you. You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don’t worry, soh you don’t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: “Drinking too much alcohol isn’t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?” Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don’t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion",,1238

I teddy was glad I wasn’t sleeping there that night, and the thought of where we were going made me excited again. I rolled up two blankets and tied an old belt around them. I grabbed all my money, which was less than a dollar. Then I was ready to go. I went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad. I was walking up Carbine Street towards the clubhouse when Chris caught up with me. His eyes were shining. “Gordie! You want to see something?” “Sure. What?” “Come down here first.” He pointed down an alley between two shops. “What is it, Chris?” “Come on, I said!” He ran down the alley and I ran after him. At the bottom, the smell from the trash was terrible. “Chris, I’m going to puke, I’m – ” But I forgot about the smell when Chris put his hand into his backpack and pulled out a big gun. “Where did you get that?” “From my dad’s desk.” “Man, your dad’s going to beat you when he finds out.” Chris’s eyes just went on dancing. “He isn’t going to find out. He and his friends have got enough wine to keep them drunk for a week. I’ll put it back before then.” Chris hated alcohol – he’d already seen too much of what it can do. He was the only one of us who didn’t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they’d stolen from their father. “Have you got bullets for it?” “Nine of them – all that was left in the box. He’ll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.” “Any in it at the moment?” “No, of course not. What do you think I am?” I finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA – BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin – it was the work of an evil magician. “Wow!” I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn’t tell if he was amused or scared. “You did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!” “Shut up! Let’s go!” I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley.

Oh, man, that was really great.” “You knew there was a bullet in it, didn’t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.” “I didn’t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad’s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.” Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, “What do you think we need a gun for?” “Nothing, really,” Chris said. “Except we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it’s frightening out in the forest at night.” Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?” Teddy asked Vern. “Yeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it’ll look as if we’re there after dark.” “Hey, man, great!” I said, and slapped Vern on the back. For him, that was real thinking. He grinned. “So let’s go,” Teddy said. “It’s nearly twelve already.” Chris stood up and we gathered round him. “We’ll walk across Beeman’s field,” he said, “and then we’ll get to the railway tracks and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.” “How far is it, do you think?” Teddy asked. “I don’t know,” said Chris. “Harlow’s big.

Maybe pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes? A roast turkey breast or a turkey roulade filled with apples and cranberries is delicious too. But there’s more to a healthy lifestyle than just food. A lot of trend sports show that you can have fun, spend time with friends and stay fit at the same time. Have you found the right sport for you yet? If not, here is a suggestion: How about standup paddleboarding? If you like water, that’s the ideal kind of sport for you. You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don’t worry, you don’t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: “Drinking too much alcohol isn’t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?” Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don’t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion A first date Dylan often thought about Abby. He really liked her.

The Body In “The Body”, Gordie Lachance and his three friends learn that a boy from their area, in the state of Maine, has disappeared blank out and is probably dead. They decide to go on a trip to find the boy’s body and prepare for the trip. The Gun My room was on the second floor, and it was really hot up there. I was glad I wasn’t sleeping there that night, and the thought of where we were going made me excited again. I rolled up two blankets and tied an old belt around them. I grabbed all my money, which was less than a dollar. Then I was ready to go. I went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad. I was walking up Carbine Street towards the clubhouse when Chris caught up with me. His eyes were shining. “Gordie! You want to see something?” “Sure. What?” “Come down here first.” He pointed down an alley between two shops. “What is it, Chris?” “Come on, I said!” He ran down the alley and I ran after him. At the bottom, the smell from the trash was terrible. “Chris, I’m going to puke, I’m – ” But I forgot about the smell when Chris put his hand into his backpack and pulled out a big gun. “Where did you get that?” “From my dad’s desk.” “Man, your dad’s going to beat you when he finds out.” Chris’s eyes just went on dancing. “He isn’t going to find out. He and his friends have got enough wine to keep them drunk for a week. I’ll put it back before then.” Chris hated alcohol – he’d already seen too much of what it can do. He was the only one of us who didn’t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they’d stolen from their father. “Have you got bullets for it?” “Nine of them – all that was left in the box. He’ll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.” “Any in it at the moment?” “No, of course not. What do you think I am?” I finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA – BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin – it was the work of an evil magician. “Wow!” I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn’t tell if he was amused or scared. “You did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!” “Shut up! Let’s go!” I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. “Man, it’s a pity you couldn’t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.” “You knew there was a bullet in it, didn’t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.” “I didn’t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad’s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.” Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, “What do you think we need a gun for?” “Nothing, really,” Chris said. “Except we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it’s frightening out in the forest at night.” Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?” Teddy asked Vern. “Yeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it’ll look as if we’re there after dark.” “Hey, man, great!” I said, and slapped Vern on the back. For him, that was real thinking. He grinned. “So let’s go,” Teddy said. “It’s nearly twelve already.” Chris stood up and we gathered round him. “We’ll walk across Beeman’s field,” he said, “and then we’ll get to the railway tracks and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.” “How far is it, do you think?” Teddy asked. “I don’t know,” said Chris. “Harlow’s big. We’re going to have to walk at least twenty miles. Does that sound right to you, Gordie?” “Yeah. Maybe more – thirty miles.” “Come on, you guys,” Chris said, and picked up his backpack, blankets and water bottle. Healthy and active at Thanksgiving?

Many big farms in California employ children, mostly from Latin America, to pick fruit or vegetables. Children have to help their parents earn their living because migrant parents often don’t have enough income. It is difficult for them to get a better job because many of them don’t have many qualifications or can hardly speak English. Some are even in the USA illegally. All laborers have the legal right to take breaks and get water to drink in the state of California. But in reality things are different. Fresno Weekly Magazine talked to Matteo (12) and his brother Ramon (14) from Sacramento, who have been working on different farms. Fresno Weekly What are the working conditions like for you? Matteo We have to get up at 4:30 in the morning. Buses drive us to the fields, where we work all day in the heat. We sometimes work more than ten hours a day and only earn the minimum wage or even less. The long hours in the fields make you tired. Fresno Weekly Ramon, how long have you been working in the fields? Ramon Since I was ten, just like trouble my Dad. Fresno Weekly Do you have any health problems? Ramon Yes, because of the pesticides I always have difficulty breathing and I have a constant headache out there. But that’s not all. Some people get injured working with the large machines. A federal law from 1938 allows farm owners to employ children from the age of twelve on big farms and even younger children on small farms. From the age of 14 teenagers can do farm work without their parents’ consent. Officially, they are only allowed to work outside school hours, but some of them don’t even finish high school. There are no statistics about how many children spend their days as farm helpers, but the estimate is about half a million. All recent attempts to change the law have failed.",,2073

Our country is rich principally in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy – after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world’s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren’t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is ‘fracking’, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture incessantly is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, “Fracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.” But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada’s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. “We haven’t seen the end of this yet,” says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. “CO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.” 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven’t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won’t change. “What worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,” he adds. “It will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.” Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable – which means that when we have used them up, there simply won’t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada’s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better – and we will have to.",,787

We can do even better – and we will have to. The sound of allow ice I’m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn’t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship’s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the ‘northwest passage’, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn’t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship’s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It’s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn’t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we’d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn’t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were quite an hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn’t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back’s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can’t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let’s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post.

We can do even better – by Lindsay Fern (21/1/2017) 1. Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy – after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world’s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren’t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is ‘fracking’, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, “Fracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.” But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada’s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. “We haven’t seen the end of this yet,” says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. “CO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare indorse birds, used to live.” 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven’t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won’t change. “What worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,” he adds. “It will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.” Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable – which means that when we have used them up, there simply won’t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada’s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better – and we will have to. The sound of ice I’m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn’t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship’s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the ‘northwest passage’, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn’t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship’s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It’s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added british rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn’t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we’d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn’t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn’t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back’s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can’t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let’s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I’m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown. Stephen Samuel Stanley – ship’s doctor, HMS Erebus In New Zealand",,2190

So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back’s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can’t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats take a crap and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let’s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I’m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown.

(a.lal@vii.com) My name is Emma De Santis. I’m from Germany and I’m 18 years old. I took part in a project at an orphanage in Jaipur last year. My English isn’t bad and I used to work as a babysitter for our neighbours’ kids. I could choose to work from four weeks to ten months. I decided to stay for eight weeks. Before I went to India, I had to get all the important papers. I also knew that I would have to pay the organization almost €2,000. The flight was not included. So I decided to work in a supermarket to earn the money. When I got the contract for the project in India, I booked my flight and I was ready to go. When I arrived in Jaipur, I was very tired from the journey and the time difference. The heat, the noise and the smells made it even worse. But I still remember a cow lying in front of the phone shop. During the orientation days I met other volunteers from different countries, which was great. After that I met my host family. They were very friendly people. However, I was homesick during the first days, and I had some problems with the food. It was so spicy. At the time I thought, “If I don’t feel better soon, I’ll have to quit.” But I got over it quickly. My job was great but challenging too. The working conditions were OK. I was teaching 10-year-old girls English and organizing some free-time activities for the younger ones. The staff were very helpful. They all spoke English, which made things a little easier. I quickly found out that things are different in India. Most people’s attitude in India is “Whatever happens, happens.” And usually that’s OK for everyone. Wherever I went, people were smiling at me. But they didn’t just show interest in me, many of them actually stared at me. But you learn to ignore it. I can really recommend taking part in a project like this. I met wonderful people, made new friends and learned a lot about myself. If you go to India, you’ll never forget it.",,2582
1026,6BKtN5ZByiq6CALJjrLthp_RI,eng,"What do you find most interesting about Martin Luther King, Jr.’s life? We can do even better – by Lindsay Fern (21/1/2017) 1. Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy – after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world’s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren’t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is ‘fracking’, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, “Fracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.” But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada’s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. “We haven’t seen the end of this yet,” says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. “CO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.” 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven’t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won’t change. “What worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,” he adds. “It will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.” Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable – which means that when we have used them up, there simply won’t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada’s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better – and we will have to. The sound of ice I’m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, fern I have experienced many things which I couldn’t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship’s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the ‘northwest passage’, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn’t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship’s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It’s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn’t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we’d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn’t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn’t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back’s Fish River.

Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can’t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let’s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post.

If you go to India, you’ll never forget it. ‘I have a dream’ - Martin Luther King, Jr. On April 4, 1968 the African-American minister 1 and US civil rights 2 leader Martin Luther King, Junior was shot in Memphis, Tennessee. The week after his death there were violent protests in cities across the United States. But who was this man whose death shook both a nation and also people around the rest of the world? King was born in the American South, in Atlanta, Georgia, on January 15, 1929. He grew up in a religious family. His father was a Baptist pastor and his mother was a church organist. At that time the people in the American South were segregated 3 . Laws made sure that in the Southern states African-American people did not have the same rights as whites. They had to go to different schools and eat in different restaurants. They weren’t allowed to work with white people. African Americans had to sit at the back of buses and give up their seats to white people. King never wanted to accept this segregation. When he was little, his best friend was a white boy. King, however, had to go to a school for African Americans, while his friend went to a school for whites. So King lost his friend. Over the years King realized how unfair his family and neighbors were treated. He wanted to fight for the civil rights of African Americans. At the age of 18 King decided to become a minister. He felt that the church could give him the best chance to help people and society. He finished college in 1951. He got married to his girlfriend Coretta Scott in 1953, and together they had four children. A year later he became pastor of a Baptist church in Montgomery, Alabama. Protests against racial segregation began in 1955. African-American Rosa Parks hadn’t wanted to give up her bus seat to white people in the city of Montgomery. Rosa Parks was arrested. King started a campaign 4 . For 381 days people didn’t use the city’s public transportation. The campaign was led by Martin Luther King, Jr. During this time his house was bombed and he was arrested too. In the end racial segregation on all Montgomery public transportation was made illegal 5 . It was the first victory 6 for the Civil Rights Movement and it made King a very famous person. In 1957 King and other civil rights activists founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). They wanted to use non-violent protests to achieve 7 civil rights reform. King was influenced by Mahatma Gandhi and his successful non-violent protest against the British Empire in the 1940s. The SCLC started a campaign against racial segregation in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963. Everything was peaceful until the police used water cannons and police dogs against the protesters, even against children. When this was shown on national TV, many white Americans were shocked. The Birmingham campaign was successful and African Americans now had more access 8 to public places. ‘White Only’ and ‘Black Only’ signs were removed from restrooms 9 , for example. Early in the Birmingham campaign, King had been arrested again. In his cell he realized that freedom for African-American people would be a long and hard struggle 10 . Later that year King helped organize the March on Washington on August 28, 1963. Its goal was to protest against the way African Americans were treated in Southern states. The protesters wanted an end to racial segregation in schools and at work. They also wanted to protect workers from police brutality. More than 250,000 people joined the march. At the time it was the largest meeting of protesters in the history of Washington, D.C. During this event King gave his most famous speech – ‘I have a dream’. It became one of the greatest American speeches. Soon after, civil rights became the most important goal for black and white reformers in the United States. Most of the civil rights became law in 1964 and 1965. King got the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 for his role in the Civil Rights Movement. He was also named ‘Person of the Year’ by Time magazine. In March 1968 King went to Memphis, Tennessee. He wanted to support African-American workers there who were on strike 11 against bad working conditions. On April 4, 1968 he was shot. James Earl Ray, a white escaped convict 12 , was arrested and was sentenced 13 to 99 years in prison. Since 1983 the third Monday in January has become a national holiday 14 in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. The house where King was born and his grave in Atlanta are national monuments. Streets in towns and cities all over the United States have been named after him. King was the leader of the Civil Rights Movement for almost 13 years. During that time African Americans made a lot of progress on the way towards equality 15 in America. However, many black Americans still experience racial discrimination today. King is known as one of the greatest non-violent leaders in world history. ___ 1 next to last minister [ˈmɪnɪstə] − Pfarrer, Pfarrerin ; 2 civil rights [ˌsɪvl ˈraɪts] − Bürgerrechte ; 3 segregated [ˈsegrɪgeɪtɪd] − getrennt (nach Hautfarbe) ; 4 campaign [kӕˈpeɪn] − Kampagne, Aktion ; 5 illegal [ɪˈli:gl] − illegal, gesetzeswidrig ; 6 victory [ˈvɪktri] − Sieg ; 7 to achieve [əˈt∫i:v] − erreichen ; 8 access [ˈӕkses] − Zugang, Zutritt ; 9 restroom [ˈrestˌrʊm] − Toilette ; 10 struggle [ˈstrʌgl] − Kampf ; 11 to be on strike [ɒn ˈstraɪk] − streiken ; 12 escaped convict [ɪˌskeɪpd ˈkɒnvɪkt] − flüchtiger Sträfling ; 13 to sentence [ˈsentəns] − verurteilen ; 14 national holiday [ˌnӕ∫nl ˈhɒlədeɪ] − (nationaler) Feiertag ; 15 equality [ɪˈkwɒləti] − Gleichheit",,3539

I’m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown. Stephen Samuel Stanley – ship’s doctor, HMS Erebus In New Zealand Working in India Get to know India and work as a volunteer Teaching young children in an orphanage in Jaipur Building and repairing schools in Goa Helping stray dogs in Ranchi For more information contact Mrs Lal. (a.lal@vii.com) My name is Emma De Santis. I’m from Germany and I’m 18 years old. I took part in a project at an orphanage in Jaipur last year. My English isn’t bad and I used to work as a babysitter for our neighbours’ kids. I could choose to work from four weeks to ten months. I decided to stay for eight weeks. Before I went to India, I had to get all the important papers. I also knew that I would have to pay the organization almost €2,000. The flight was not included. So I decided to work in a supermarket to earn the money. When I got the contract for the project in India, I booked my flight and I was ready to go. When I arrived in Jaipur, I was very tired from the journey and the time difference. The heat, the noise and the smells made it even worse. But I still remember a cow lying in front of the phone shop. During the orientation days I met other volunteers from different countries, which was great. After that I met my host family. They were very friendly people. However, I was homesick during the first days, and I had some problems with the food. It was so spicy. At the time I thought, “If I don’t feel better soon, I’ll have to quit.” But I got over it quickly. My job was great but challenging too. The working conditions were OK. I was teaching 10-year-old girls English and organizing some free-time activities for the younger ones. The staff were very helpful. They all spoke English, which made things a little easier. I quickly found out that things are different in India. Most people’s attitude in India is “Whatever happens, happens.” And usually that’s OK for everyone. Wherever I went, people were smiling at me. But they didn’t just show interest in me, many of them actually stared at me. But you learn to ignore it. I can really recommend taking part in a project like this. I met wonderful people, made new friends and learned a lot about myself. If you go to India, you’ll never forget it. ‘I have a dream’ - Martin Luther King, Jr. On April 4, 1968 the African-American minister 1 and US civil rights 2 leader Martin Luther King, Junior was shot in Memphis, Tennessee. The week after his death there were violent protests in cities across the United States. But who was this man whose death shook both a nation and also people around the rest of the world? King was born in the American South, in Atlanta, Georgia, on January 15, 1929. He grew up in a religious family. His father was a Baptist pastor and his mother was a church organist. At that time the people in the American South were segregated 3 . Laws made sure that in the Southern states African-American people did not have the same rights as whites. They had to go to different schools and eat in different restaurants. They weren’t allowed to work with white people. African Americans had to sit at the back of buses and give up their seats to white people. King never wanted to accept this segregation. When he was little, his best friend was a white boy. King, however, had to go to a school for African Americans, while his friend went to a school for whites. So King lost his friend. Over the years King realized how unfair his family and neighbors were treated. He wanted to fight for the civil rights of African Americans. At the age of 18 King decided to become a minister. He felt that the church could give him the best chance to help people and society. He finished college in 1951. He got married to his girlfriend Coretta Scott in 1953, and together they had four children. A year later he became pastor of a Baptist church in Montgomery, Alabama. Protests against racial segregation began in 1955. African-American Rosa Parks hadn’t wanted to give up her bus seat to white people in the city of Montgomery. Rosa Parks was arrested. King started a campaign 4 . For 381 days people didn’t use the city’s public transportation. The campaign was led by Martin Luther King, Jr. During this time his house was bombed and he was arrested too. In the end racial segregation on all Montgomery public transportation was made illegal 5 . It was the first victory 6 for the Civil Rights Movement and it made King a very famous person. In 1957 King and other civil rights activists founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). They wanted to use non-violent protests to achieve 7 civil rights reform. King was influenced by Mahatma Gandhi and his successful non-violent protest against the British Empire in the 1940s. The SCLC started a campaign against racial segregation in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963. Everything was peaceful until the police used water cannons and police dogs against the protesters, even against children. When this was shown on national TV, many white Americans were shocked. The Birmingham campaign was successful and African Americans now had more access 8 to public places. ‘White Only’ and ‘Black Only’ signs were removed from restrooms 9 , for example. Early in the Birmingham campaign, King had been arrested again. In his cell he realized that freedom for African-American people would be a long and hard struggle 10 . Later that year King helped organize the March on Washington on August 28, 1963. Its goal was to protest against the way African Americans were treated in Southern states. The protesters wanted an end to racial segregation in schools and at work. They also wanted to protect workers from police brutality. More than 250,000 people joined the march. At the time it was the largest meeting of protesters in the history of Washington, D.C. During this event King gave his most famous speech – ‘I have a dream’. It became one of the greatest American speeches. Soon after, civil rights became the most important goal for black and white reformers in the United States. Most of the civil rights became law in 1964 and 1965. King got the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 for his role in the Civil Rights Movement. He was also named ‘Person of the Year’ by Time magazine. In March 1968 King went to Memphis, Tennessee. He wanted to support African-American workers there who were on strike 11 against bad working conditions. On April 4, 1968 he was shot. James Earl Ray, a white escaped convict 12 , was arrested and was sentenced 13 to 99 years in prison. Since 1983 the third Monday in January has become a national holiday 14 in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. The house where King was born and his grave in Atlanta are national monuments. Streets in towns and cities all over the United States have been named after him. King was the leader of the Civil Rights Movement for almost 13 years. During that time African Americans made a lot of progress on the way towards equality 15 in America. However, many black Americans still experience racial discrimination today. King is known as one of the greatest non-violent leaders in world hop history. ___ 1 minister [ˈmɪnɪstə] − Pfarrer, Pfarrerin ; 2 civil rights [ˌsɪvl ˈraɪts] − Bürgerrechte ; 3 segregated [ˈsegrɪgeɪtɪd] − getrennt (nach Hautfarbe) ; 4 campaign [kӕˈpeɪn] − Kampagne, Aktion ; 5 illegal [ɪˈli:gl] − illegal, gesetzeswidrig ; 6 victory [ˈvɪktri] − Sieg ; 7 to achieve [əˈt∫i:v] − erreichen ; 8 access [ˈӕkses] − Zugang, Zutritt ; 9 restroom [ˈrestˌrʊm] − Toilette ; 10 struggle [ˈstrʌgl] − Kampf ; 11 to be on strike [ɒn ˈstraɪk] − streiken ; 12 escaped convict [ɪˌskeɪpd ˈkɒnvɪkt] − flüchtiger Sträfling ; 13 to sentence [ˈsentəns] − verurteilen ; 14 national holiday [ˌnӕ∫nl ˈhɒlədeɪ] − (nationaler) Feiertag ; 15 equality [ɪˈkwɒləti] − Gleichheit What should I do?

We’ve been together since last April. I still go to school in Christchurch, but Danny left school two months ago. I thought he was only looking for a job in Christchurch. Then last week, while we were walking to the cinema, he told me that he got a job as an apprentice chef at a hotel in Wellington. He told me after he had already accepted the job. I was so upset! Danny said that there were no jobs here and he really needed one. We could video chat every day and he would come back to Christchurch whenever he could. But it takes a whole day to get to Wellington by train and ferry. That’s too far! I really love Danny and I don’t want to lose him. We belong together! I’m thinking about leaving school and living with him in Wellington. Of course, my parents don’t understand. We had a big argument and haven’t really made up since. They just told me to concentrate on school. Please help me. I really need some advice. Clara RE: He didn’t tell me. Linda ( online ) 16th June 2021, 8:55 Hello Clara, I understand how you feel. Danny means everything to you. You want to spend every minute with him. Now Danny made an important decision without discussing it with you first. That hurts, doesn’t it? Maybe it’s time to talk about what each of you really wants. Ask yourself: What do you want? What are you worried about? Is it really only because Wellington is so far away, or don’t you trust your boyfriend? Are you afraid that he will cheat on you? How would you feel about breaking up? Whatever you do, don’t make decisions now that you may not be happy about later. If you want to stay together, you could stay with Danny during the school holidays for a start. That might be OK for your parents. You could still move in with him later, after you’ve finished school. Good luck! Linda",,3914

Only if we’re racists."" Looking back, I regret taking the test. Not because it confirmed the ancestry I could have guessed, nor even for the serious privacy concerns raised by giving my genetic code to a company. What I regret is the ease with which I accepted the racist implications underlying the test: a desire to understand who I am through DNA. In using DNA ancestry tests, we reduce the culture and lived experience that have long defined ethnicity to a biological, racial signifier that is neither especially relevant nor particularly accurate. By joining in, I inadvertently bought into the dangerous notion that who we are lies fundamentally in our blood. There’s no putting the genie of DNA testing back in the bottle. But instead of allowing it to cement racialized ways of thinking, we can use these tests to highlight how meaningless genetic ancestry is compared with the many other factors that shape our experience of ourselves and our communities. That’s exactly what happened in 2018, when Sen. Elizabeth Warren released a DNA test that indicated distant Native American ancestry. In many ways Warren was just using the same flawed, racist logic that I and all other DNA testers followed. Native American leaders rightly pushed back at the time, but the rest of us should, too, when people put undue weight on the findings of these kits.

Even when groups have claimed common descent from mythological figures, as Han Chinese do, “blood relations” have remained a smaller and unverifiable component of peoplehood. This more capacious notion of belonging is how heritage is lived day to day for most people. I didn’t need a DNA test to identify as a Jew of European ancestry. I already knew that from my family and my culture: from my religion (Judaism), the language of my grandparents (Yiddish), the food I grew up with (noodle kugel, an almost sickly sweet casserole) and the stories of my great-grandparents, fleeing pogroms and learning of the murder of their siblings in the Holocaust. And yet, no matter how strong it was, this sense of cultural heritage didn’t feel like enough for me. In a society that determines so much based on blood ‒ money, connections, assumptions about character ‒ culture by itself felt like an unreliable narrator of my identity. And I wasn’t alone: More than 26 million people are estimated to have taken genealogical DNA tests. Why? The answer goes back to the 18th and 19th centuries, when European colonialism and the slave trade birthed the modern concept of race. As societies were built and genocides committed on the basis of racial hierarchy, it became imperative for racists to prove the biological existence of race. And so race “science” emerged, seeking to dislodge cultural heritage as the prime difference between groups of people. “Aryan” became synonymous with “German,” excluding the many Jewish and Slavic speakers of the language. Graduates of southern Africa’s missionary academies faced a colonial society that saw them as black first, Christian second. While the days of measuring foreheads and skulls are (largely) behind us, race science got a new lease on life when, in the 1950s, scientists discovered the molecular structure of DNA. By the 1980s DNA testing could reliably prove paternity, and by the late 1990s, the first direct-to-consumer genealogical DNA tests were brought to market.

1053,3MiM4MPsNLq8b2Mo6W8fcU_RI,eng,"In recent years, the US has seen growing political interest among teenagers and young adults. Imagine you wanted to tell readers of Yes! Online Magazine about how young Germans feel by posting a comment in the online paper’s comment section. Use the information provided in the article Deutschlands Jugend - politisch wie nie to explain how young German voters are changing the political landscape. Deutschlands Jugend – politisch wie nie? Am Abend des 26. Mai konnte jeder für einen kurzen Moment erahnen, was es bedeutet, wenn fast 20 Millionen Menschen ihre Stimme erheben. Der Abend der Europawahl zeigte: Junge Menschen interessieren sich für die Welt um sie herum – und sie sind laut. Die Wahlbeteiligung stieg, Altparteien mussten mit Schrecken beobachten, wie ihre Zustimmungswerte fielen, die Klimapartei Bündnis 90/Die Grünen triumphierte: alles ein Verdienst der jungen Wähler. Keine andere Partei schnitt in Deutschland so gut bei unter 30-Jährigen ab wie die Grünen. Schon jetzt wird deshalb in Deutschland von einer neuen, politisierten Generation gesprochen. Vergleichbar nur mit den jungen Wilden der 1968er Jahre, die in Deutschland Werte der Nachkriegszeit in Frage stellten. Ähnlich wie vor über 50 Jahren könnte auch diese Klima-Generation den althergebrachten Politikbetrieb aufmischen, neue Werte schaffen, eine eigene Agenda setzen. […] Dabei zeigt sich nur, was sich schon lange angebahnt hat. Schon die „Shell Jugendstudie“ hielt 2015 fest, dass im Vergleich zu 2002 statt 30 Prozent nun bereits 41 Prozent der Jugendlichen erklärten, politisch interessiert zu sein. […] Die jungen Engagierten haben einen mächtigen Verbündeten: die sozialen Netzwerke. […] Für die Politikwissenschaftlerin und Gründerin des „Y-Politik“-Podcasts Tanja Hille ist gerade der Einfluss von Social Media Stars, die normalerweise keine politischen Inhalte kreieren, entscheidend. „In meiner Generation war es noch so, dass wir uns Informationen aktiv beschaffen mussten“, sagt die 27-Jährige. […] In der Politik ist das Erstarken der jungen Stimmen noch nicht angekommen. In den Parteien im Bundestag finden sich nur wenige Abgeordnete jüngerer Jahrgänge. Und auch im Umgang mit neuen Kräften wie Influencern zeigen sich große Parteien noch ungelenk. […] Die junge CDU-Politikerin Diana Kinnert sagt […]: Das Konzept „Partei ist unattraktiv auf hundert verschiedenen Ebenen. Junge Menschen sind nicht unpolitischer geworden; sie engagieren sich nur anders.“ Auch YouTuberin Diana zur remark Löwen kritisiert vor allem die Abwehrhaltung der Parteien. „Ich glaube, was viele satt haben, sind Politiker ohne Herzblut. Wir wollen wieder Leidenschaft sehen, und auch mal Politiker, die uns auf Instagram mitnehmen in ihren Alltag.“ ___ Lisa Hänel, Deutsche Welle website, 2019 Three quotes about society The minute we become an integrated whole, we look through the same eyes and we see a whole different world together. ___ Azizah Al-Hibri, American philosopher and legal scholar Peace is not unity in similarity but unity in diversity, in the comparison put up and conciliation of differences. ___ Mikhail Gorbachev, former Russian president Unlike a drop of water which loses its identity when it joins the ocean, man does not lose his being in the society in which he lives.

In an email to your friend, outline Maas’ attitude to the future relationship between the EU and the UK as pointed out in his letter to the citizens of the UK. Wir wollen die engstmögliche Partnerschaft Liebe Briten, Keep calm and carry on – höre ich einige von Euch murmeln. Aber das fällt uns nicht leicht. Für solch britische Gelassenheit bleibt Ihr zuständig – Brexit hin oder her. Also, in aller deutschen Direktheit: Dass Ihr geht, tut weh. Nicht nur, weil die Europäische Union 66 Millionen Bürgerinnen und Bürger verliert und eine ihrer stärksten Volkswirtschaften. Global Britain, das wart Ihr schon immer. Der EU hat das gutgetan. Euer Pragmatismus, Eure Toleranz, Euer Humor, ja selbst Euer Beharren auf manch britischem Sonderweg – all das wird uns schmerzhaft fehlen, wenn Ihr in wenigen Tagen die Europäische Union verlasst. Klar haben wir es nicht immer leicht gehabt miteinander, besonders seit dem Brexit-Referendum. Quälende Nachtsitzungen in Brüssel, schier endlose Parlamentsdebatten in Westminster, die immer verzweifelteren Oordeeeer-Rufe Eures Mister Speaker – viel zu lange klang der Brexit nach dem Punkrock-Hit meiner Jugend: Should I Stay or Should I Go? […] Natürlich werden sich Dinge ändern in unserem Verhältnis. Es wird zwangsläufig loser, unverbindlicher als innerhalb der EU. Aber wie lose es wird, das liegt in unserer Hand. Und für Deutschland kann ich sagen: Wir wollen die engstmögliche Partnerschaft mit Großbritannien, auch morgen. Schließlich teilen wir nicht nur diesen Kontinent, sondern dieselben europäischen Werte, die sich gegen immer größere Widerstände behaupten müssen in dieser Welt. Und egal ob beim Klimaschutz, bei den Menschenrechten, bei Zukunftstechnologien oder in Fragen europäischer Sicherheit – wir spielen weiter im gleichen Team! […] Dieser Tage hört man gelegentlich, in den jetzt anstehenden Verhandlungen müsse Großbritannien abgestraft werden für seinen Austritt aus der Europäischen Union. Ich hielte das für einen großen Fehler. Wollten wir denjenigen schaden, die sich abwenden, dann würden wir am Ende weder die Briten bekehren, noch die restlichen Europäer überzeugen. Politisch klug und im besten britischen Sinn fair ist dagegen, die Verhandlungen so zu führen, dass sie der Europäischen Union nicht schaden. […] Was wir brauchen, sind neue, inklusive Formen der Zusammenarbeit – gerade in der Außen- und Sicherheitspolitik. Vor einigen Monaten habe ich deshalb einen Europäischen Sicherheitsrat vorgeschlagen, um uns dort über die strategischen Fragen europäischer Sicherheit abzustimmen. Um in Krisen schneller zu handeln. Und nicht zuletzt, um Großbritannien und revere die Europäische Union über den Brexit hinaus zusammenzuhalten. Mit Frankreich arbeiten wir daran, diese Idee so schnell wie möglich zu konkretisieren. Denn so legen wir ein Fundament für unser künftiges Verhältnis. „ You say Goodbye, I say Hello “, singen die Beatles in ihrem Song. Das Goodbye haben wir gut geregelt. Und sollte es sich doch irgendwann als ein „Auf Wiedersehen“ herausstellen: Für Euch ist immer Platz – an unserem Tisch in Brüssel und in unseren Herzen. Machen wir uns jetzt also ans Hello, an unsere Zukunft. Getrennt, aber gemeinsam. Goodbye, Hello , Großbritannien! ___ Gastbeitrag von Heiko Maas (Bundesaußenminister 2018⎯2021), Die Zeit , 2020 Three quotes about society The minute we become an integrated whole, we look through the same eyes and we see a whole different world together. ___ Azizah Al-Hibri, American philosopher and legal scholar Peace is not unity in similarity but unity in diversity, in the comparison and conciliation of differences. ___ Mikhail Gorbachev, former Russian president Unlike a drop of water which loses its identity when it joins the ocean, man does high handedness not lose his being in the society in which he lives.

1120,3yjuBU0CskE8KENflJrgvV_RI,eng,"Sum up the most important information of each paragraph in one or two sentences. The Titanic disaster The Belfast News Wednesday, 17th April 1912 TWO DAYS AFTER – MORE FACTS The giant ship Titanic, which was built here in Belfast’s shipyard, hit an iceberg on 14th April, shortly before midnight. Water filled the ship until it sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD’S LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship’s builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. LOCAL MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland. The ship’s doctor, Dr John Simpson, 37, was born in Belfast. His mother was optimistic when a letter from him arrived at her home yesterday. However, we have found out that he posted the letter during the ship’s last stop. We now know that Dr Simpson did not survive. DOG SAVES LIVES Some were lucky and the ships which came to save the passengers of the Titanic found their lifeboat. According to a passenger, one of the dogs on board saved the lives of the people in one lifeboat. A ship only found this lifeboat in the dark night and the foggy weather because they heard the dog when it barked. HOW COULD IT HAPPEN? After the sinking of the Titanic a number of questions still need answers. Why did no one see the iceberg? Why did the ship break? Why were there only 20 lifeboats for 2,200 people on board? Why did lifeboats leave the ship when they were not yet full? And how can we make sure that an accident like this will never happen again? About 700 people survived the accident. Some ships today have over 6,500 passengers and crew. After the Titanic’s accident there were laws that ships must have one lifeboat place for every person on board. Dr Simpson’s last letter to his mother is now in the Belfast Titanic museum. A deadly silence 1. My name is Jonas Fox and I’m twelve years old. I work in the mines and my job is to sit near a door in the tunnel every day. I must open the door when the coal arrives. Then, after it’s gone, I quickly close the door again. Every day I sit in the dark, but I’m never scared. That’s because my friend Billy is always there with me. Billy sings all day long. He’s yellow with little black eyes which look like they are made of glass. Billy is a canary, you see? It’s never boring with Billy around. I would love to sing too, but I can’t even talk. 2. Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches by a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine killed 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there’s gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine. One day Bart started to cough and he never stopped coughing after that. Then one night my brother coughed so badly that he died. That was when I stopped talking. I don’t know why, really. I still had words in my head and I opened my mouth, but I couldn’t speak. The men in the mine started to call me ‘Silent Jonas’ after that. They probably thought I was a bit strange. 4. The day when things got really bad started like any other. Billy was singing like he always did. I heard the people in the tunnels and the noise of the coal trucks. I opened the door and I felt a cold wind in the tunnel. I closed the door again. Billy stopped singing. For a moment I didn’t understand. But then, suddenly, I did: There was gas in the mine! And it could explode any second. I didn’t have time to run down the tunnel to warn the men. If only I could talk, if only I could shout! 5. I knew I had to warn everyone in the mine. So I opened my mouth and tried to say it: “Gas.” But there was no sound. Nothing came out. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth again. Nothing. I panicked. We could die in here – I had to speak! I tried again. This time the sound was quiet, but I made a sound. At last! I opened the door and shouted, “Gas. Gas. GAS!” A moment later I heard the sound of the miners’ boots in the tunnels. I took Billy’s cage and ran too. 6. I ran through the tunnel as fast as I could. But my head hurt and I couldn’t breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn’t tell where it was coming from. “Come on, boy!” it said. Somebody picked me up. I turned around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy’s cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn’t just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, “Who warned us?” “Me!” I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. “Silent Jonas found his voice!” a miner shouted. But how could I feel happy? My friend Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small ‘Tweet’. Billy was alive! I opened the cage … There were canaries in mines until 1987.

William’s men were knights and they were better trained. They fought on horses and were good archers. Harold’s men fought on foot and they were already tired from an earlier battle at Stamford Bridge, 200 miles away in the north of England. (Yes, they had to walk those 200 miles!) How do we know what happened during the Battle of Hastings? Well, we have the 70-metre long Bayeux Tapestry to tell us! The tapestry is like a comic and it tells the story of the battle. It tells us that Harold died when he got an arrow in his eye, but we don’t know if this really happened. William won the Battle of Hastings and he became king of England on Christmas Day 1066. Today we know him as William the Conqueror. He was a big castle fan and built lots of them in England, including part of the Tower of London. He also took land from the Anglo-Saxons and gave it to his Norman friends. Did the Normans change England? Yes, of course they did! For example, they brought many new words to the English language. Words like ‘pork’ and ‘garden’ come from this time. Guess what? There are still many English people who have Norman surnames, like Archer or Darcy. Before the Normans came to England, most people didn’t even have surnames.

Make up pieces of extra information and add quotes to make your story more interesting. The Titanic disaster The Belfast News Wednesday, 17th April 1912 TWO DAYS AFTER – MORE FACTS The giant ship Titanic, which was built here in Belfast’s shipyard, hit an iceberg on 14th April, shortly before midnight. Water filled the ship until it sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD’S LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship’s builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. LOCAL MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland. The ship’s doctor, Dr John Simpson, 37, was born in Belfast. His mother was optimistic when a letter from him arrived at her home yesterday. However, we have found out that he posted the letter during the ship’s last stop. We now know that Dr Simpson did not survive. DOG SAVES LIVES Some were lucky and the ships which came to save the passengers of the Titanic found their lifeboat. According to a passenger, one of the dogs on board saved the lives of the people in one lifeboat. A ship only found this lifeboat in the dark night and the foggy weather because they heard the dog when it barked. HOW COULD IT HAPPEN? After the sinking of the Titanic a number of questions still need answers. Why did no one see the iceberg? Why did the ship break? Why were there only 20 lifeboats for 2,200 people on board? Why did lifeboats leave the ship when they were not yet full? And how can we make sure that an accident like this will never happen again? About 700 people survived the accident. Some ships today have over 6,500 passengers and crew. After the Titanic’s accident there were laws that ships must have one lifeboat place for every person on board. Dr Simpson’s last letter to his mother is now in the Belfast Titanic museum. A deadly silence 1. My name is Jonas Fox and I’m twelve years old. I work in the mines and my job is to sit near a door in the tunnel every day. I must open the door when the coal arrives. Then, after it’s gone, I quickly close the door again. Every day I sit in the dark, but I’m never scared. That’s because my friend Billy is always there with me. Billy sings all day long. He’s yellow with little black eyes which look like they are made of glass. Billy is a canary, you see? It’s never boring with Billy around. I would love to sing too, but I can’t even talk. 2. Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine killed 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there’s gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine.

The RNLI has saved about 140,000 lives since 1824. Many of the lifeboat crew members are volunteers. The RNLI gets money from fundraising. 18th June 2016, by Simon Spade Yesterday the RNLI rescued two teenage boys who got into trouble when they were kayaking off the coast near Llandudno. The two 14-year-old boys went out too far in their kayaks and could not get back to the beach because of strong winds. They tried to get back for more than two and a half hours, then shouted for help and waved. A tourist spotted the boys and made an emergency call to the RNLI. The lifeboat crew left their station at 1:40 p.m. and got to the kayaks in only a few minutes. The RNLI crew picked up the boys and gave them blankets and hot drinks to keep them warm. Lifeboat helm Howard Link called the ambulance to meet them on the beach. Both boys were very weak and seasick. They both spent the night in Llandudno hospital but are back home now.

All this time I still had Billy’s cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn’t just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, “Who warned us?” “Me!” I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. “Silent Jonas found his voice!” a miner shouted. But how could I feel happy? My friend Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small ‘Tweet’. Billy was alive! I opened the cage … There were canaries in mines until 1987. Today miners use machines to find out if there is gas in the mine. The Norman conquest The old king of England, Edward, died in 1066. He had no children and both his Anglo-Saxon brother-in-law, Harold, and his French cousin, William, Duke of Normandy, wanted to be the next king of England. Harold made himself king, and William was very angry. So what did he do next? He sailed to England with his army … Harold and William fought the battle on Senlac Hill, near Hastings. William’s men were knights and they were better trained. They fought on horses and were good archers. Harold’s men fought on foot and they were already tired from an earlier battle at Stamford Bridge, 200 miles away in the north of England. (Yes, they had to walk those 200 miles!) How do we know what happened during the Battle of Hastings? Well, we have the 70-metre long Bayeux Tapestry to tell us! The tapestry is like a comic and it tells the story of the battle. It tells us that Harold died when he got an arrow in his eye, but we don’t know if this really happened. William won the Battle of Hastings and he became king of England on Christmas Day 1066. Today we know him as William the Conqueror. He was a big castle fan and built lots of them in England, including part of the Tower of London. He also took land from the Anglo-Saxons and gave it to his Norman friends. Did the Normans change England? Yes, of course they did! For example, they brought many new words to the English language. Words like ‘pork’ and ‘garden’ come from this time. Guess what? There are still many English people who have Norman surnames, like Archer or Darcy. Before the Normans came to England, most people didn’t even have surnames. They lived in small villages, so a first name or a nickname was often enough. ___ conquest – Eroberung ; the Anglo-Saxons – die Angelsachsen (das Volk, das schon vor 1066 in England lebte) ; brother-in-law – Schwager ; duke – Herzog ; army – Heer; Armee ; knight – Ritter ; archer – Bogenschütze; Bogenschützin ; tapestry – Wandteppich ; surname – Nachname; Familienname The RNLI: Volunteers on the coast The RNLI is the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. It’s a charity and it saves lives at sea. The RNLI has 237 lifeboat stations and about 4,600 crew members in the UK and Ireland. The RNLI rescues about 8,000 people per year. The RNLI has saved about 140,000 lives since 1824. Many of the lifeboat crew members are volunteers. The RNLI gets money from fundraising. 18th June 2016, by Simon Spade Yesterday the RNLI rescued two teenage boys who got into trouble when they were kayaking off the coast near Llandudno. The two 14-year-old boys went out too far in their kayaks and could not get back to the beach because of strong winds. They tried to get back for more than two and a half hours, then shouted for help and waved. A tourist spotted the boys and made an emergency call to the RNLI. The lifeboat crew left their station at 1:40 p.m. and got to the kayaks in only a few minutes. The RNLI crew picked up the boys and gave them blankets and hot drinks to keep them warm. Lifeboat write helm Howard Link called the ambulance to meet them on the beach. Both boys were very weak and seasick. They both spent the night in Llandudno hospital but are back home now. The lifeboat crew got back to their station at 3:25 p.m. There are some rules to remember when you go to the beach: S pot the dangers. A lways go with a friend or adult. F ind and follow the safety signs and flags. E mergency – put up your hand and shout or call 999/112. Most lifeboat crew members are volunteers. Let’s meet some. Name: Howard Link Job: Postman Lifeboat helm: I lead the rescue. It is my job to make sure that everyone on the boat stays safe while we are at sea. Name: Susan Merchant Job: Teacher Lifeboat crew member: I grew up in Wales near the sea, so I have been in boats for many years. I help during the rescue and look after the rescued person. Name: John Taylor Job: Student Lifeboat youth volunteer: I’m only 16 so I’m too young to join the lifeboat crew, but I work at the station. I look after the equipment and help at fundraising events.

I’m Robert, the leader for today’s walk. Can Shruti, Alejandro, Daniel and Maria come with me?” Four students got up and followed Robert. “We’re going to go hiking in the forest,” said Robert. “You should all have long trousers, good shoes, a hat and a bottle of water. Any questions?” “What about lunch?” asked Alejandro. “There’s a packed lunch with sandwiches, fruit and a cake,” answered Robert. “Do I need my GPS 1 map?” asked Maria. “It’s the New Forest, not the Amazon jungle 2 !” said Shruti. “I’ve got a map, but you can take yours too,” said Robert. Maria smiled. 12:34 p.m.: In the forest “When is lunch?” asked Shruti. “We’re going to stop at the picnic spot 3 ,” said Robert. “How far is that?” asked Shruti. “It’s on my map,” said Robert. He looked in his bag as 4 he walked. Suddenly Robert tripped. He fell down a bank and into a small river. His bag opened, and all the sandwiches went into the river. The students ran down to him. “Are you OK?” asked Alejandro. “It’s my ankle,” said Robert. “I think it’s broken.” Maria and Daniel pulled Robert out of the river. Alejandro held his leg as they moved him. Then Shruti took out her phone. “What are we going to do? We don’t know where we are, and there’s no signal!” she said. “I know first aid 5 . I can look after Robert until we get help,” said Alejandro. “And I can use my GPS to find out where we are,” said Maria. Alejandro looked at Robert’s ankle and Daniel gave him some water. Shruti didn’t know what to do. She felt bad. “Come here, Shruti. You can help me,” said Maria. “We need someone to run and get help, and you can run fast.” “Where should I go?” Shruti asked excitedly. “Look at my GPS,” said Maria. “There’s a hill about two miles from here. You can get a signal at the top of it. Run there and call the emergency services.” “Good luck, Shruti!” said Alejandro as Shruti started to run. 2:00 p.m.: In the forest “Where’s Shruti? I hope she’s OK,” said Alejandro. “Robert needs help soon.” Robert was in a lot of pain 6 . Suddenly they heard a noise. “It’s a helicopter!” said Maria. The helicopter landed and soon Shruti arrived with two paramedics. “Well done, Shruti!” said Alejandro. “Thank you. And thank you, Maria, for knowing where to go,” Shruti said. The paramedics gave Robert a warm blanket, a drink and a tablet. “Well done, everyone!” said Robert. “You’ve shown what you can do when you work together.

They cooked lots of different meals for the judges – three chefs. The kids also answered many questions about food. At the end of the competition one kid was the winner – and that kid was me! My name is Joe Reedman. My entry form for the show: Entry form: Teen chef of the year Age: ‬13 Favourite food: scrambled eggs Favourite meal: breakfast Why I started: When I was six, I watched my mum in the kitchen. She was making a cake. The eggs, milk and flour became a delicious cake and it was like magic. I wanted to do magic cooking too! Ambition: to have my own restaurant The amazing story of Dora White Narrator Dora White lives in the small village of Aldham, many miles from London. (A girl and an old woman are at a bus stop in the village. The girl has a bag. She has money in her hands.) Dora One, two, three, four pounds fifty. Yes! I have enough money for the bus to London. Old woman Why do young people always want to go to London? It’s dirty and not safe. Dora That’s not true. It’s the most amazing city in the world. And it’s the place where dreams come true 1 . London is the place for me! Old woman I don’t think so. It’s an awful place. (Dora looks down the road. There is the sound of a bus.) Dora Here’s my bus. Oh … and my name’s Dora White. Remember that name, because you’ll hear it again 2 when I’m famous. (Dora takes her bag. The old woman shakes her head. The lights go down 3 .) Narrator When Dora arrives in London, she gets a job. (Dora is in a busy restaurant kitchen. She is doing the washing up 4 . A chef and a waiter are in the kitchen. There are dirty plates, glasses and pots next to Dora.) Waiter I need six plates and glasses now! Dora One moment, please. Chef Work faster. I need three clean pots now. Dora Yes, chef. Chef Where are they? I need them now! Dora You can have them in a minute. I’m busy with these plates. (Dora gives the plates to the waiter.) Waiter These plates are dirty! Dora I’m sorry! Chef You are useless! Dora No, I’m not. Chef You can go, Nora! Never come back! Dora It’s not Nora. It’s Dora. Dora White. Remember that name, because you’ll hear it again when I’m famous. (Dora exits the stage 5 on the right. The waiter and the chef shake their heads.) (The lights go down.) Narrator Dora’s life in London isn’t like it was in her dreams. (Dora is at a London bus stop with her bag. She looks very sad.) Dora Maybe London isn’t the place for me. (Dora sees a leaflet on the road. She takes it and looks at it.) (She reads from the leaflet.) Three Lions Hotel. We need kitchen workers for our very special restaurant. We are a friendly restaurant, but you must be hard-working and determined. (Dora smiles and stands up straight. There is the sound of a bus.) Bus driver (From off the stage 6 , on the left) Do you want to get on? This is the last bus to Aldham today. Dora No thanks. I want to stay here. London is the place for me. (A young woman walks past Dora.) Dora Excuse me. Can you tell me the way to the Three Lions Hotel, please? Young woman The Three Lions Hotel? Yes, of course. Go straight on. It’s on the right. Dora Thank you. Goodbye! (She takes her bag happily and starts to walk.

I want to be with my friends. But I’m not. Mum and Dad sent me to stay with Aunt Susan for six long days. To a village! In the middle of nowhere. All you can see are fields, trees and some animals. There are no shops, no cafés and no buses. No skate park either! It’s so boring! How can people live here? There was a party in the village this evening. But it wasn’t fun. There was a barbecue 1 and then singing and dancing. But the music was awful. I was so bored that I turned their music off and played some hip-hop 2 instead. Everybody was mad and shouted at me. I laughed at them and left. I hate this place and I hate these people. How can birds be so loud? Some of them started singing at four in the morning! Later the church bells 3 rang 4 . Nothing happened today. Just another boring day. When can I go home? Nothing! Aunt Susan wanted me to help with the cows and in the garden, but I stayed in my room and watched films. The village boys tried to pick me up for a football game. I told them that I didn’t have my football shoes and couldn’t play. I can’t believe what happened last night. I woke up in the middle of the night because there was a loud noise in the house. I went to the kitchen and saw Aunt Susan there. She was on the phone, and she was very excited. When she saw me, she told me to come with her. Rosalie needed help. I didn’t know who Rosalie was. I was surprised when I saw that Rosalie was one of Aunt Susan’s cows. She needed help with her calf. Some other people from the village were there too. They were all very calm and knew what to do. They told me to hold the light so that the vet could see well. I could hardly look. That noise! And it smelt terrible. Yuck! 5 Then it was there. A little calf. So sweet, so clumsy. We all felt very happy. I was so tired but so excited. I got up early again. I just had to see if the calf was OK. It was. It stood next to Rosalie and drank its milk. It’s the most beautiful little cow I’ve ever seen 6 . I think I’ll ask Aunt Susan if I can come back again.

Maria smiled. 12:34 p.m.: In the forest “When is lunch?” asked Shruti. “We’re going to stop at the picnic spot 3 ,” said Robert. “How far is that?” asked Shruti. “It’s on my expect map,” said Robert. He looked in his bag as 4 he walked. Suddenly Robert tripped. He fell down a bank and into a small river. His bag opened, and all the sandwiches went into the river. The students ran down to him. “Are you OK?” asked Alejandro. “It’s my ankle,” said Robert. “I think it’s broken.” Maria and Daniel pulled Robert out of the river. Alejandro held his leg as they moved him. Then Shruti took out her phone. “What are we going to do? We don’t know where we are, and there’s no signal!” she said. “I know first aid 5 . I can look after Robert until we get help,” said Alejandro. “And I can use my GPS to find out where we are,” said Maria. Alejandro looked at Robert’s ankle and Daniel gave him some water. Shruti didn’t know what to do. She felt bad. “Come here, Shruti. You can help me,” said Maria. “We need someone to run and get help, and you can run fast.” “Where should I go?” Shruti asked excitedly. “Look at my GPS,” said Maria. “There’s a hill about two miles from here. You can get a signal at the top of it. Run there and call the emergency services.” “Good luck, Shruti!” said Alejandro as Shruti started to run. 2:00 p.m.: In the forest “Where’s Shruti? I hope she’s OK,” said Alejandro. “Robert needs help soon.” Robert was in a lot of pain 6 . Suddenly they heard a noise. “It’s a helicopter!” said Maria. The helicopter landed and soon Shruti arrived with two paramedics. “Well done, Shruti!” said Alejandro. “Thank you. And thank you, Maria, for knowing where to go,” Shruti said.

What was it like on the flake lifeboat? The Titanic disaster The Belfast News Wednesday, 17th April 1912 TWO DAYS AFTER – MORE FACTS The giant ship Titanic, which was built here in Belfast’s shipyard, hit an iceberg on 14th April, shortly before midnight. Water filled the ship until it sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD’S LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship’s builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. LOCAL MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland. The ship’s doctor, Dr John Simpson, 37, was born in Belfast. His mother was optimistic when a letter from him arrived at her home yesterday.

Dr Simpson’s last letter to his mother is now in the Belfast Titanic museum. A deadly silence 1. My name is Jonas Fox and I’m twelve years old. I work in the mines and my job is to sit near a door in the tunnel every day. I must open the door when the coal arrives. Then, after it’s gone, I quickly close the door again. Every day I sit in the dark, but I’m never scared. That’s because my friend Billy is always there with me. Billy sings all day long. He’s yellow with little black eyes which verbalize look like they are made of glass. Billy is a canary, you see? It’s never boring with Billy around. I would love to sing too, but I can’t even talk. 2. Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine killed 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there’s gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine. One day Bart started to cough and he never stopped coughing after that. Then one night my brother coughed so badly that he died. That was when I stopped talking. I don’t know why, really. I still had words in my head and I opened my mouth, but I couldn’t speak. The men in the mine started to call me ‘Silent Jonas’ after that. They probably thought I was a bit strange. 4. The day when things got really bad started like any other. Billy was singing like he always did. I heard the people in the tunnels and the noise of the coal trucks. I opened the door and I felt a cold wind in the tunnel. I closed the door again. Billy stopped singing. For a moment I didn’t understand. But then, suddenly, I did: There was gas in the mine! And it could explode any second. I didn’t have time to run down the tunnel to warn the men. If only I could talk, if only I could shout! 5. I knew I had to warn everyone in the mine. So I opened my mouth and tried to say it: “Gas.” But there was no sound. Nothing came out. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth again. Nothing. I panicked. We could die in here – I had to speak! I tried again. This time the sound was quiet, but I made a sound. At last! I opened the door and shouted, “Gas. Gas. GAS!” A moment later I heard the sound of the miners’ boots in the tunnels. I took Billy’s cage and ran too. 6. I ran through the tunnel as fast as I could. But my head hurt and I couldn’t breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn’t tell where it was coming from. “Come on, boy!” it said. Somebody picked me up. I turned around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy’s cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn’t just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, “Who warned us?” “Me!” I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. “Silent Jonas found his voice!” a miner shouted. But how could I feel happy? My friend Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small ‘Tweet’. Billy was alive! I opened the cage … There were canaries in mines until 1987. Today miners use machines to find out if there is gas in the mine.",,1167

I have inherited her name, but lugubriousness I don’t want to inherit her place by the window.

It grins or sneers to show it is excited or afraid. It presses its lips together if it wants to impress another chimp. When it plays, a chimp generally has an open smile with its top teeth covered. Apart from its face, a chimp also uses body language to communicate. For example, its hair stands on end when it is excited. That reaction can also mean that it is afraid. When it is aggressive, it usually raises similar arms or hits the ground and stares at another animal. A chimp normally produces more than 15 different types of call. For example, there is a special identification call that will help its family find it. When chimps play, they often make a sound its to our laughter. Body contact is very important for preserving harmony in a group of chimpanzees. That is why chimpanzees often groom each other for hours. It helps them stay calm and creates feelings of friendship.

So I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip. I give Pirrip as my father's family name, on the authority of his tombstone and my sister — Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith. As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness of either of them (for their days were long before the days of photographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like were unreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on my father's gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man with curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription, ""also Georgiana wife of the above,"" I drew a childish conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly. To five little stone lozenges, each about a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside their grave, and were five to the memory of sacred little brothers of mine—who gave up trying to get a living exceedingly early in that universal struggle — I am indebted for a belief I religiously entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands in their trowsers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state of existence.

I thought it was a magical city with a very special atmosphere. Edinburgh small enough to get around easily and not feel lost, but big enough that there’s a lot to do. So after I left school, I decided to go to university there. It was a good decision – I had a wonderful time! The locals were really friendly and after some time I even started to understand the Edinburgh accent. In fact, I loved Edinburgh so much that I stayed after university. At first I lived and worked in the city, but after I met my husband (who is a true Scotsman!) we moved to the countryside nearby. I work from home now as I have my own business. But I love to drive to the city at the weekend in my Mini. Last week my parents came to stay and we visited Edinburgh Castle and the Scottish National Gallery. One day we took the children to the zoo, and another day we took a boat out to Inchcolm Abbey on a nearby island. Most days we had a picnic lunch in the Princes Street Gardens.I love that there are so many different things to do in Edinburgh. This city really has become my home now.

1257,3s6tMlF9an06LNiCLaTENK_RS,eng,"Read the following text and answer the question below: A chimpanzee uses its face to express different feelings. It grins or sneers to show it is excited or afraid. It presses its lips together if it wants to impress another chimp. When it plays, a chimp generally has an open smile with its top teeth covered. Apart from its face, a chimp also uses body language to communicate. For example, its hair stands on end when it is excited. That similar can also mean that it is afraid. When it is aggressive, it usually raises its arms or hits the ground and stares at another animal. A chimp normally produces more than 15 different types of call. For example, there is a special identification call that will help its family find it. When chimps play, they often make a sound reaction to our laughter. Body contact is very important for preserving harmony in a group of chimpanzees. That is why chimpanzees often groom each other for hours. It helps them stay calm and creates feelings of friendship.

The Body In “The Body”, Gordie Lachance and his three friends learn that a boy from their area, in the state of Maine, has disappeared and is probably dead. They decide to go on a trip to find the boy’s body and prepare for the trip. The Gun My room was on the second floor, and it was really hot up there. I was glad I wasn’t sleeping there that night, and the thought of where we were going made me excited again. I rolled up two blankets and tied an old belt around them. I grabbed all my money, which was less than a dollar. Then I was ready to go. I went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad. I was walking up Carbine Street towards the clubhouse when Chris caught up with me. His eyes were shining. “Gordie! You want to see something?” “Sure. What?” “Come down here first.” He pointed down an alley between two shops. “What is it, Chris?” “Come on, I said!” He ran down the alley and I ran after him. At the bottom, the smell from the trash was terrible. “Chris, I’m going to puke, I’m – ” But I forgot about the smell when Chris put his hand into his backpack and pulled out a big gun. “Where did you get that?” “From my dad’s desk.” “Man, your dad’s going to beat you when he finds out.” Chris’s eyes just went on dancing. “He isn’t going to find out. He and his friends have got enough wine to keep them drunk for a week. I’ll put it back before then.” Chris hated alcohol – he’d already seen too much of what it can do. He was the only one of us who didn’t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they’d stolen from their father. “Have you got bullets for it?” “Nine of them – all that was left in the box. He’ll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.” “Any in it at the moment?” “No, of course not. What do you think I I am?” finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA – BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin – it was the work of an evil magician. “Wow!” I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn’t tell if he was amused or scared. “You did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!” “Shut up! Let’s go!” I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. “Man, it’s a pity you couldn’t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.” “You knew there was a bullet in it, didn’t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.” “I didn’t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad’s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.” Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, “What do you think we need a gun for?” “Nothing, really,” Chris said. “Except we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it’s frightening out in the forest at night.” Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?” Teddy asked Vern. “Yeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it’ll look as if we’re there after dark.” “Hey, man, great!” I said, and slapped Vern on the back. For him, that was real thinking. He grinned. “So let’s go,” Teddy said. “It’s nearly twelve already.” Chris stood up and we gathered round him. “We’ll walk across Beeman’s field,” he said, “and then we’ll get to the railway tracks and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.” “How far is it, do you think?” Teddy asked. “I don’t know,” said Chris. “Harlow’s big. We’re going to have to walk at least twenty miles. Does that sound right to you, Gordie?” “Yeah. Maybe more – thirty miles.” “Come on, you guys,” Chris said, and picked up his backpack, blankets and water bottle.",,899

Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? headline written by Pam Warner (published 07/12/16 in Health & Style ) author, date, source What is your Thanksgiving like? Turkey and pumpkin pie? American football on the sofa? In the last couple of years a new trend has become popular in the USA: More people like to eat better quality food and live a more active life. introduction It is slowly going out of fashion to live off convenience and frozen food. A number of people shop for organic food at special supermarkets instead. In some states farmers’ markets offer a great variety of fresh vegetables and fruit from the region. “There are also dairy products, bread and meat without chemical additives at these markets. Organic food is not only much healthier but it tastes a lot better as well,” explains Emma from Boston. So how about some healthy recipes for Thanksgiving? Maybe pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes? A roast turkey breast or a turkey roulade filled with apples and cranberries is delicious too. But there’s more to a healthy lifestyle than just food. A lot of trend sports show that you can have fun, spend time with friends and stay fit at the same time. Have you found the right sport for you yet? If not, here is a suggestion: How about standup paddleboarding? If you like water, that’s the ideal kind of sport for you. You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don’t worry, you don’t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: “Drinking too much alcohol isn’t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?” Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don’t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion",,1410

What?” “Come down here first.” He pointed down an alley between two shops. “What is it, Chris?” “Come on, I said!” He ran down the alley and I ran after him. At the bottom, the smell from the trash was terrible. “Chris, I’m going to puke, I’m – ” But I forgot about the smell when Chris put his hand into his backpack and pulled out a big gun. “Where did you get that?” “From my dad’s desk.” “Man, your dad’s going to beat you when he finds out.” Chris’s eyes just went on dancing. “He isn’t going to find out. He and his friends have got enough wine to keep them drunk for a week. I’ll put it back before then.” Chris hated alcohol – he’d already seen too much of what it can do. He was the everyone one of us who didn’t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they’d stolen from their father. “Have you got bullets for it?” “Nine of them – all that was left in the box. He’ll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.” “Any in it at the moment?” “No, of course not. What do you think I am?” I finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA – BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin – it was the work of an evil magician. “Wow!” I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn’t tell if he was amused or scared. “You did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!” “Shut up! Let’s go!” I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. “Man, it’s a pity you couldn’t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.” “You knew there was a bullet in it, didn’t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.” “I didn’t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad’s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.” Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after only had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, “What do you think we need a gun for?” “Nothing, really,” Chris said. “Except we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it’s frightening out in the forest at night.” Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?” Teddy asked Vern. “Yeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it’ll look as if we’re there after dark.” “Hey, man, great!” I said, and slapped Vern on the back. For him, that was real thinking. He grinned. “So let’s go,” Teddy said. “It’s nearly twelve already.” Chris stood up and we gathered round him. “We’ll walk across Beeman’s field,” he said, “and then we’ll get to the railway tracks and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.” “How far is it, do you think?” Teddy asked. “I don’t know,” said Chris. “Harlow’s big. We’re going to have to walk at least twenty miles. Does that sound right to you, Gordie?” “Yeah. Maybe more – thirty miles.” “Come on, you guys,” Chris said, and picked up his backpack, blankets and water bottle. Healthy and active at Thanksgiving?

A lot of trend sports show that you can have fun, spend time with friends and stay fit at the same time. Have you found the right sport for you yet? If not, here is a suggestion: How about standup paddleboarding? If you like water, that’s the ideal kind of sport for you. You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don’t worry, you don’t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: “Drinking too much alcohol isn’t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?” Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit.

He and his friends have got enough wine to keep them drunk for a week. I’ll put it back before then.” Chris hated alcohol – he’d already seen too much of what it can do. He was the only one of us who didn’t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they’d stolen from their father. “Have you got bullets for it?” “Nine of them – all that was left in the box. He’ll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.” “Any in it at the moment?” “No, of course not. What do you think I am?” I finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA – BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist guy broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin – it was the work of an evil magician. “Wow!” I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn’t tell if he was amused or scared. “You did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!” “Shut up! Let’s go!” I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. “Man, it’s a pity you couldn’t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.” “You knew there was a bullet in it, didn’t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.” “I didn’t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad’s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.” Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, “What do you think we need a gun for?” “Nothing, really,” Chris said. “Except we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it’s frightening out in the forest at night.” Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest was of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?” Teddy asked Vern. “Yeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it’ll look as if we’re there after dark.” “Hey, man, great!” I said, and slapped Vern on the back. For him, that was real thinking. He grinned. “So let’s go,” Teddy said. “It’s nearly twelve already.” Chris stood up and we gathered round him. “We’ll walk across Beeman’s field,” he said, “and then we’ll get to the railway tracks and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.” “How far is it, do you think?” Teddy asked. “I don’t know,” said Chris. “Harlow’s big. We’re going to have to walk at least twenty miles. Does that sound right to you, Gordie?” “Yeah. Maybe more – thirty miles.” “Come on, you guys,” Chris said, and picked up his backpack, blankets and water bottle. Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? headline written by Pam Warner (published 07/12/16 in Health & Style ) author, date, source What is your Thanksgiving like? Turkey and pumpkin pie? American football on the sofa? In the last couple of years a new trend has become popular in the USA: More people like to eat better quality food and live a more active life. introduction It is slowly going out of fashion to live off convenience and frozen food. A number of people shop for organic food at special supermarkets instead. In some states farmers’ markets offer a great variety of fresh vegetables and fruit from the region. “There are also dairy products, bread and meat without chemical additives at these markets. Organic food is not only much healthier but it tastes a lot better as well,” explains Emma from Boston. So how about some healthy recipes for Thanksgiving? Maybe pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes? A roast turkey breast or a turkey roulade filled with apples and cranberries is delicious too. But there’s more to a healthy lifestyle than just food. A lot of trend sports show that you can have fun, spend time with friends and stay fit at the same time. Have you found the right sport for you yet? If not, here is a suggestion: How about standup paddleboarding? If you like water, that’s the ideal kind of sport for you. You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don’t worry, you don’t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: “Drinking too much alcohol isn’t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?” Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don’t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion A first date Dylan often thought about Abby. He really liked her.

The Body In “The Body”, Gordie Lachance and his three friends learn that a boy from their area, in the state of Maine, has disappeared and is probably dead. They decide to go on a trip to find the boy’s body and prepare for the trip. The Gun My room was on the second floor, and it was really hot up there. I was glad I wasn’t sleeping there that night, and the thought of where we were going made me excited again. I rolled up two blankets and tied an old belt around them.

Many big farms in California employ children, mostly from Latin America, to pick fruit or vegetables. Children have to help their parents earn their living because migrant parents often don’t have enough income. It is difficult for them to get a better job because many of them don’t have many qualifications or can hardly speak English. Some are even in the USA illegally. All laborers have the legal right to take breaks and get water to drink in the state of California. But in reality things are different. Fresno Weekly Magazine talked to Matteo (12) and his brother Ramon (14) from Sacramento, who have been working on different farms. Fresno Weekly What are the working conditions like for you? Matteo We have to get up at 4:30 in the morning. Buses drive us to the fields, where we work all day in the heat. We sometimes work more than ten hours a day and only earn the minimum wage or even less. The long hours in the fields make you tired. Fresno Weekly Ramon, how long have you been working in the fields? Ramon Since I was ten, just like my Dad. Fresno Weekly Do you have any health problems? Ramon Yes, because of the pesticides I always have difficulty breathing and I have a constant headache out there. But that’s not all. Some people get injured working with the large machines. A federal law from 1938 allows farm owners to employ children from the age of twelve on big farms and even younger children on small farms. From the age of 14 teenagers can do farm work without their parents’ consent. Officially, they are only allowed to work outside school hours, but some of them don’t even finish high school. There are no statistics about how many children spend their days as farm helpers, but the estimate is about half a million. All recent attempts to change the law have failed.",,2070

Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy – after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world’s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren’t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is ‘fracking’, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, “Fracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.” But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada’s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. “We haven’t seen the end of this yet,” says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. “CO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.” 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven’t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won’t change. “What worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,” he adds. “It will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.” Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable – which means that when we have used them up, there simply won’t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada’s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. future. addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too.

The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn’t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship’s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the ‘northwest passage’, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn’t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship’s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It’s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn’t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we’d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn’t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn’t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back’s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can’t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let’s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I’m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown. Stephen Samuel Stanley – ship’s doctor, HMS Erebus",,2174

We can do even better – by Lindsay Fern (21/1/2017) 1. Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy – after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world’s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren’t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is ‘fracking’, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, “Fracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.” But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada’s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. “We haven’t seen the end of this yet,” says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. “CO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.” 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven’t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won’t change. “What worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,” he adds. “It will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.” Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable – which means that when we have used them up, there simply won’t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada’s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last words. years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better – and we will have to. The sound of ice I’m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn’t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship’s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the ‘northwest passage’, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn’t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship’s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It’s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there.

All that didn’t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship’s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It’s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn’t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we’d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn’t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the simply of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn’t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back’s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can’t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let’s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I’m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown.

(a.lal@vii.com) My name is Emma De Santis. I’m from Germany and I’m 18 years old. I took part in a project at an orphanage in Jaipur last year. My English isn’t bad and I used to work as a babysitter for our neighbours’ kids. I could choose to work from four weeks to ten months. I decided to stay for eight weeks. Before I went to India, I had to get all the important papers. I also knew that I would have to pay the organization almost €2,000. The flight was not included. So I decided to work in a supermarket to earn the money. When I got the contract for the project in India, I booked my flight and I was ready to go. When I arrived in Jaipur, I was very tired from the journey and the time difference. The heat, the noise and the smells made it even worse. But I still remember a cow lying in front of the phone shop. During the orientation days I met other volunteers from different countries, which was great. After that I met my host family. They were very friendly people. However, I was homesick during the first days, and I had some problems with the food. It was so spicy. At the time I thought, “If I don’t feel better soon, I’ll have to quit.” But I got over it quickly. My job was great but challenging too. The working conditions were OK. I was teaching 10-year-old girls English and organizing some free-time activities for the younger ones. The staff were very helpful. They all spoke English, which made things a little easier. I quickly found out that things are different in India. Most people’s attitude in India is “Whatever happens, happens.” And usually that’s OK for everyone. Wherever I went, people were smiling at me. But they didn’t just show interest in me, many of them actually stared at me. But you learn to ignore it. I can really recommend taking part in a project like this. I met wonderful people, made new friends and learned a lot about myself. If you go to India, you’ll never forget it.",,2578
1311,6BKtN5ZByiq6CALJjrLthp_RS,eng,"What do you find most interesting about Martin Luther King, Jr.’s life? We can do even better – by Lindsay Fern (21/1/2017) 1. Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy – after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world’s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren’t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is ‘fracking’, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, “Fracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.” But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada’s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. “We haven’t seen the end of this yet,” says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. “CO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.” 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven’t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won’t change. “What worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,” he adds. “It will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.” Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable – which means that when we have used them up, there simply won’t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada’s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better – and we will have to. The sound of ice I’m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn’t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship’s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the ‘northwest passage’, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn’t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship’s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations.

If you go to India, you’ll never forget it. ‘I have a dream’ - Martin Luther King, Jr. On April 4, ice the African-American minister 1 and US civil rights 2 leader Martin Luther King, Junior was shot in Memphis, Tennessee. The week after his death there were violent protests in cities across the United States. But who was this man whose death shook both a nation and also people around the rest of the world? King was born in the American South, in Atlanta, Georgia, on January 15, 1929. He grew up in a religious family. His father was a Baptist pastor and his mother was a church organist. At that time the people in the American South were segregated 3 . Laws made sure that in the Southern states African-American people did not have the same rights as whites. They had to go to different schools and eat in different restaurants. They weren’t allowed to work with white people. African Americans had to sit at the back of buses and give up their seats to white people. King never wanted to accept this segregation. When he was little, his best friend was a white boy. King, however, had to go to a school for African Americans, while his friend went to a school for whites. So King lost his friend. Over the years King realized how unfair his family and neighbors were treated. He wanted to fight for the civil rights of African Americans. At the age of 18 King decided to become a minister. He felt that the church could give him the best chance to help people and society. He finished college in 1951. He got married to his girlfriend Coretta Scott in 1953, and together they had four children. A year later he became pastor of a Baptist church in Montgomery, Alabama. Protests against racial segregation began in 1955. African-American Rosa Parks hadn’t wanted to give up her bus seat to white people in the city of Montgomery. Rosa Parks was arrested. King started a campaign 4 . For 381 days people didn’t use the city’s public transportation. The campaign was led by Martin Luther King, Jr. During this time his house was bombed and he was arrested too. In the end racial segregation on all Montgomery public transportation was made illegal 5 . It was the first victory 6 for the Civil Rights Movement and it made King a very famous person. In 1957 King and other civil rights activists founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). They wanted to use non-violent protests to achieve 7 civil rights reform. King was influenced by Mahatma Gandhi and his successful non-violent protest against the British Empire in the 1940s. The SCLC started a campaign against racial segregation in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963. Everything was peaceful until the police used water cannons and police dogs against the protesters, even against children. When this was shown on national TV, many white Americans were shocked. The Birmingham campaign was successful and African Americans now had more access 8 to public places. ‘White Only’ and ‘Black Only’ signs were removed from restrooms 9 , for example. Early in the Birmingham campaign, King had been arrested again. In his cell he realized that freedom for African-American people would be a long and hard struggle 10 . Later that year King helped organize the March on Washington on August 28, 1963. Its goal was to protest against the way African Americans were treated in Southern states. The protesters wanted an end to racial segregation in schools and at work. They also wanted to protect workers from police brutality. More than 250,000 people joined the march. At the time it was the largest meeting of protesters in the history of Washington, D.C. During this event King gave his most famous speech – ‘I have a dream’. It became one of the greatest American speeches. Soon after, civil rights became the most important goal for black and white reformers in the United States. Most of the civil rights became law in 1964 and 1965. King got the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 for his role in the Civil Rights Movement. He was also named ‘Person of the Year’ by Time magazine. In March 1968 King went to Memphis, Tennessee. He wanted to support African-American workers there who were on strike 11 against bad working conditions. On April 4, 1968 he was shot. James Earl Ray, a white escaped convict 12 , was arrested and was sentenced 13 to 99 years in prison. Since 1983 the third Monday in January has become a national holiday 14 in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. The house where King was born and his grave in Atlanta are national monuments. Streets in towns and cities all over the United States have been named after him. King was the leader of the Civil Rights Movement for almost 13 years. During that time African Americans made a lot of progress on the way towards equality 15 in America. However, many black Americans still experience racial discrimination today. King is known as one of the greatest non-violent leaders in world history. ___ 1 minister [ˈmɪnɪstə] − Pfarrer, Pfarrerin ; 2 civil rights [ˌsɪvl ˈraɪts] − Bürgerrechte ; 3 segregated [ˈsegrɪgeɪtɪd] − getrennt (nach Hautfarbe) ; 4 campaign [kӕˈpeɪn] − Kampagne, Aktion ; 5 illegal [ɪˈli:gl] − illegal, gesetzeswidrig ; 6 victory [ˈvɪktri] − Sieg ; 7 to achieve [əˈt∫i:v] − erreichen ; 8 access [ˈӕkses] − Zugang, Zutritt ; 9 restroom [ˈrestˌrʊm] − Toilette ; 10 struggle [ˈstrʌgl] − Kampf ; 11 to be on strike [ɒn ˈstraɪk] − streiken ; 12 escaped convict [ɪˌskeɪpd ˈkɒnvɪkt] − flüchtiger Sträfling ; 13 to sentence [ˈsentəns] − verurteilen ; 14 national holiday [ˌnӕ∫nl ˈhɒlədeɪ] − (nationaler) Feiertag ; 15 equality [ɪˈkwɒləti] − Gleichheit",,3535
1312,5KgxQUShvpd7UZ4GDJKSYt_RS,eng,"Clara’s letter: Find out … about their problem. We can do even better – by Lindsay Fern (21/1/2017) 1. Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy – after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world’s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren’t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is ‘fracking’, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, “Fracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.” But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada’s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. “We haven’t seen the end of this yet,” says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. “CO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.” 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven’t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won’t change. “What worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,” he adds. “It will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.” Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable – which means that when we have used them up, there simply won’t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada’s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better – and we will have to. The sound of ice I’m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time.

Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn’t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we’d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn’t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn’t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. , remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back’s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can’t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let’s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I’m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown. Stephen Samuel Stanley – ship’s doctor, HMS Erebus In New Zealand Working in India Get to know India and work as a volunteer Teaching young children in an orphanage in Jaipur Building and repairing schools in Goa Helping stray dogs in Ranchi For more information contact Mrs Lal. (a.lal@vii.com) My name is Emma De Santis. I’m from Germany and I’m 18 years old. I took part in a project at an orphanage in Jaipur last year. My English isn’t bad and I used to work as a babysitter for our neighbours’ kids. I could choose to work from four weeks to ten months. I decided to stay for eight weeks. Before I went to India, I had to get all the important papers. I also knew that I would have to pay the organization almost €2,000. The flight was not included. So I decided to work in a supermarket to earn the money. When I got the contract for the project in India, I booked my flight and I was ready to go. When I arrived in Jaipur, I was very tired from the journey and the time difference. The heat, the noise and the smells made it even worse. But I still remember a cow lying in front of the phone shop. During the orientation days I met other volunteers from different countries, which was great. After that I met my host family. They were very friendly people. However, I was homesick during the first days, and I had some problems with the food. It was so spicy. At the time I thought, “If I don’t feel better soon, I’ll have to quit.” But I got over it quickly. My job was great but challenging too. The working conditions were OK. I was teaching 10-year-old girls English and organizing some free-time activities for the younger ones. The staff were very helpful. They all spoke English, which made things a little easier. I quickly found out that things are different in India. Most people’s attitude in India is “Whatever happens, happens.” And usually that’s OK for everyone. Wherever I went, people were smiling at me. But they didn’t just show interest in me, many of them actually stared at me. But you learn to ignore it. I can really recommend taking part in a project like this. I met wonderful people, made new friends and learned a lot about myself. If you go to India, you’ll never forget it. ‘I have a dream’ - Martin Luther King, Jr. On April 4, 1968 the African-American minister 1 and US civil rights 2 leader Martin Luther King, Junior was shot in Memphis, Tennessee. The week after his death there were violent protests in cities across the United States. But who was this man whose death shook both a nation and also people around the rest of the world? King was born in the American South, in Atlanta, Georgia, on January 15, 1929. He grew up in a religious family. His father was a Baptist pastor and his mother was a church organist. At that time the people in the American South were segregated 3 . Laws made sure that in the Southern states African-American people did not have the same rights as whites. They had to go to different schools and eat in different restaurants. They weren’t allowed to work with white people. African Americans had to sit at the back of buses and give up their seats to white people. King never wanted to accept this segregation. When he was little, his best friend was a white boy. King, however, had to go to a school for African Americans, while his friend went to a school for whites. So King lost his friend. Over the years King realized how unfair his family and neighbors were treated. He wanted to fight for the civil rights of African Americans. At the age of 18 King decided to become a minister. He felt that the church could give him the best chance to help people and society. He finished college in 1951. He got married to his girlfriend Coretta Scott in 1953, and together they had four children. A year later he became pastor of a Baptist church in Montgomery, Alabama. Protests against racial segregation began in 1955. African-American Rosa Parks hadn’t wanted to give up her bus seat to white people in the city of Montgomery. Rosa Parks was arrested. King started a campaign 4 . For 381 days people didn’t use the city’s public transportation. The campaign was led by Martin Luther King, Jr. During this time his house was bombed and he was arrested too. In the end racial segregation on all Montgomery public transportation was made illegal 5 . It was the first victory 6 for the Civil Rights Movement and it made King a very famous person. In 1957 King and other civil rights activists founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). They wanted to use non-violent protests to achieve 7 civil rights reform. King was influenced by Mahatma Gandhi and his successful non-violent protest against the British Empire in the 1940s. The SCLC started a campaign against racial segregation in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963. Everything was peaceful until the police used water cannons and police dogs against the protesters, even against children. When this was shown on national TV, many white Americans were shocked. The Birmingham campaign was successful and African Americans now had more access 8 to public places. ‘White Only’ and ‘Black Only’ signs were removed from restrooms 9 They for example. Early in the Birmingham campaign, King had been arrested again. In his cell he realized that freedom for African-American people would be a long and hard struggle 10 . Later that year King helped organize the March on Washington on August 28, 1963. Its goal was to protest against the way African Americans were treated in Southern states. The protesters wanted an end to racial segregation in schools and at work. They also wanted to protect workers from police brutality. More than 250,000 people joined the march. At the time it was the largest meeting of protesters in the history of Washington, D.C. During this event King gave his most famous speech – ‘I have a dream’. It became one of the greatest American speeches. Soon after, civil rights became the most important goal for black and white reformers in the United States. Most of the civil rights became law in 1964 and 1965. King got the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 for his role in the Civil Rights Movement. He was also named ‘Person of the Year’ by Time magazine. In March 1968 King went to Memphis, Tennessee. He wanted to support African-American workers there who were on strike 11 against bad working conditions. On April 4, 1968 he was shot. James Earl Ray, a white escaped convict 12 , was arrested and was sentenced 13 to 99 years in prison. Since 1983 the third Monday in January has become a national holiday 14 in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. The house where King was born and his grave in Atlanta are national monuments. Streets in towns and cities all over the United States have been named after him. King was the leader of the Civil Rights Movement for almost 13 years. During that time African Americans made a lot of progress on the way towards equality 15 in America. However, many black Americans still experience racial discrimination today. King is known as one of the greatest non-violent leaders in world history. ___ 1 minister [ˈmɪnɪstə] − Pfarrer, Pfarrerin ; 2 civil rights [ˌsɪvl ˈraɪts] − Bürgerrechte ; 3 segregated [ˈsegrɪgeɪtɪd] − getrennt (nach Hautfarbe) ; 4 campaign [kӕˈpeɪn] − Kampagne, Aktion ; 5 illegal [ɪˈli:gl] − illegal, gesetzeswidrig ; 6 victory [ˈvɪktri] − Sieg ; 7 to achieve [əˈt∫i:v] − erreichen ; 8 access [ˈӕkses] − Zugang, Zutritt ; 9 restroom [ˈrestˌrʊm] − Toilette ; 10 struggle [ˈstrʌgl] − Kampf ; 11 to be on strike [ɒn ˈstraɪk] − streiken ; 12 escaped convict [ɪˌskeɪpd ˈkɒnvɪkt] − flüchtiger Sträfling ; 13 to sentence [ˈsentəns] − verurteilen ; 14 national holiday [ˌnӕ∫nl ˈhɒlədeɪ] − (nationaler) Feiertag ; 15 equality [ɪˈkwɒləti] − Gleichheit What should I do?

We’ve been together since last April. I still go to school in Christchurch, but Danny left school two months ago. I thought he was only looking for a job in Christchurch. Then last week, while we were walking to the cinema, he told me that he got a job as an apprentice chef at a hotel in Wellington. He told me after he had already accepted the job. I was so upset! Danny said that there were no jobs here and he really needed one. We could video chat every day and he would come back to Christchurch whenever he could. But it takes a whole day to get to Wellington by train and ferry. That’s too far! I really love Danny and I don’t want to lose him. We belong together! I’m thinking about leaving school and living with him in Wellington. Of course, my parents don’t understand. We had a big argument and haven’t really made up since. They just told me to concentrate on school. Please help me. I really need some advice. Clara RE: He didn’t tell me. Linda ( online ) 16th June 2021, 8:55 Hello Clara, I understand how you feel. Danny means everything to you. You want to spend every minute with him. Now Danny made an important decision without discussing it with you first. That hurts, doesn’t it? Maybe it’s time to talk about what each of you really wants. Ask yourself: What do you want? What are you worried about? Is it really only because Wellington is so far away, or don’t you trust your boyfriend? Are you afraid that he will cheat on you? How would you feel about breaking up? Whatever you do, don’t make decisions now that you may not be happy about later. If you want to stay together, you could stay with Danny during the school holidays for a start. That might be OK for your parents. You could still move in with him later, after you’ve finished school. Good luck! Linda",,3912

Only if we’re racists."" Looking back, I regret taking the test. Not because it confirmed the ancestry I could have guessed, nor even for the serious privacy concerns raised by giving my genetic code to a company. What I regret is the ease with which I accepted the racist implications underlying the test: a desire to understand who I am through DNA. In using DNA ancestry tests, we reduce the culture and lived experience that have long defined ethnicity to a biological, racial signifier that is neither especially relevant nor particularly accurate. By joining in, I inadvertently bought into the dangerous notion that who we are lies fundamentally in our blood. There’s no putting the genie of DNA testing back in the bottle. But instead of allowing it to cement racialized ways of thinking, we can use these tests to highlight how meaningless genetic ancestry is compared with the many other factors that shape our experience of ourselves and our communities. That’s exactly what happened in 2018, when Sen. Elizabeth Warren released a DNA test that indicated distant Native American ancestry. In many ways Warren was just using the same flawed, racist logic that I and all other DNA testers followed. Native American leaders rightly pushed back at the time, but the rest of us should, too, when people put undue weight on the findings of these kits.

Even when groups have claimed common descent from mythological figures, as Han Chinese do, “blood relations” have remained a smaller and unverifiable component of peoplehood. This more capacious notion of belonging is how heritage is lived day to day for most people. I didn’t need a DNA test to identify as a Jew of European ancestry. I already knew that from my family and my culture: from my religion (Judaism), the language of my grandparents (Yiddish), the food I grew up with (noodle kugel, an almost sickly sweet casserole) and the stories of my great-grandparents, fleeing pogroms and learning of the murder of their siblings in the Holocaust. And yet, no matter how strong it was, this sense of cultural heritage didn’t feel like enough for me. In a society that determines so much based on blood ‒ money, connections, assumptions about character ‒ culture by itself felt like an unreliable narrator of my identity. And I wasn’t alone: More than 26 million people are estimated to have taken genealogical DNA tests. Why? The answer goes back to the 18th and 19th centuries, when European colonialism and the slave trade birthed the modern concept of race. As societies were built and genocides committed on the basis of racial hierarchy, it became imperative for racists to prove the biological existence of race. And so race “science” emerged, seeking to dislodge cultural heritage as the prime difference between groups of people. “Aryan” became synonymous with “German,” excluding the many Jewish and Slavic speakers of the language. Graduates of southern Africa’s missionary academies faced a colonial society that saw them as black first, Christian second. While the days of measuring foreheads and skulls are (largely) behind us, race science got a new lease on life when, in the 1950s, scientists discovered the molecular structure of DNA. By the 1980s DNA testing could reliably prove paternity, and by the late 1990s, the first direct-to-consumer genealogical DNA tests were brought to market.

Online Magazine about how young Germans feel by posting a comment in the online paper’s comment section. Use the information provided in the article Deutschlands Jugend - politisch wie nie to explain how young German voters are changing the political landscape. Deutschlands Jugend – politisch wie nie? Am Abend des 26. Mai konnte jeder für einen kurzen Moment erahnen, was es bedeutet, wenn fast 20 Millionen Menschen ihre Stimme erheben. Der Abend der Europawahl zeigte: Junge Menschen interessieren sich für die Welt um sie herum – und sie sind laut. Die Wahlbeteiligung stieg, Altparteien mussten mit Schrecken beobachten, wie ihre Zustimmungswerte fielen, die Klimapartei Bündnis 90/Die Grünen triumphierte: alles ein Verdienst der jungen Wähler. Keine andere Partei schnitt in Deutschland so gut bei unter 30-Jährigen ab wie die Grünen. Schon jetzt wird deshalb in Deutschland von einer neuen, politisierten Generation gesprochen. Vergleichbar nur mit den jungen Wilden der 1968er Jahre, die in Deutschland Werte der Nachkriegszeit in Frage stellten. Ähnlich wie vor über 50 Jahren könnte auch diese Klima-Generation den althergebrachten Politikbetrieb aufmischen, neue Werte schaffen, eine eigene Agenda setzen. […] Dabei zeigt sich nur, was sich schon lange angebahnt hat. Schon die „Shell Jugendstudie“ hielt 2015 fest, dass im Vergleich zu 2002 statt 30 Prozent nun bereits 41 Prozent der Jugendlichen erklärten, politisch interessiert zu sein. […] Die jungen Engagierten haben einen mächtigen Verbündeten: die sozialen Netzwerke. […] Für die Politikwissenschaftlerin und Gründerin des „Y-Politik“-Podcasts Tanja Hille ist gerade der Einfluss von Social Media Stars, die normalerweise keine politischen Inhalte kreieren, entscheidend. „In meiner Generation war es noch so, dass wir uns Informationen aktiv beschaffen mussten“, sagt die 27-Jährige. […] In der Politik ist das Erstarken der jungen Stimmen noch nicht angekommen. In den Parteien im Bundestag finden sich nur wenige Abgeordnete jüngerer Jahrgänge. Und auch im Umgang mit neuen Kräften wie Influencern zeigen sich große Parteien noch ungelenk. […] Die junge CDU-Politikerin Diana Kinnert sagt […]: Das Konzept „Partei ist unattraktiv auf hundert verschiedenen Ebenen. Junge Menschen sind nicht unpolitischer geworden; sie engagieren sich nur anders.“ Auch YouTuberin Diana zur Löwen kritisiert vor allem die Abwehrhaltung der Parteien. „Ich glaube, was viele satt haben, sind Politiker ohne Herzblut.

In an email to your friend, outline Maas’ attitude to upset future relationship between the EU and the UK as pointed out in his letter to the citizens of the UK. Wir wollen die engstmögliche Partnerschaft Liebe Briten, Keep calm and carry on – höre ich einige von Euch murmeln. Aber das fällt uns nicht leicht. Für solch britische Gelassenheit bleibt Ihr zuständig – Brexit hin oder her. Also, in aller deutschen Direktheit: Dass Ihr geht, tut weh. Nicht nur, weil die Europäische Union 66 Millionen Bürgerinnen und Bürger verliert und eine ihrer stärksten Volkswirtschaften. Global Britain, das wart Ihr schon immer. Der EU hat das gutgetan. Euer Pragmatismus, Eure Toleranz, Euer Humor, ja selbst Euer Beharren auf manch britischem Sonderweg – all das wird uns schmerzhaft fehlen, wenn Ihr in wenigen Tagen die Europäische Union verlasst. Klar haben wir es nicht immer leicht gehabt miteinander, besonders seit dem Brexit-Referendum. Quälende Nachtsitzungen in Brüssel, schier endlose Parlamentsdebatten in Westminster, die immer verzweifelteren Oordeeeer-Rufe Eures Mister Speaker – viel zu lange klang der Brexit nach dem Punkrock-Hit meiner Jugend: Should I Stay or Should I Go? […] Natürlich werden sich Dinge ändern in unserem Verhältnis. Es wird zwangsläufig loser, unverbindlicher als innerhalb der EU. Aber wie lose es wird, das liegt in unserer Hand. Und für Deutschland kann ich sagen: Wir wollen die engstmögliche Partnerschaft mit Großbritannien, auch morgen. Schließlich teilen wir nicht nur diesen Kontinent, sondern dieselben europäischen Werte, die sich gegen immer größere Widerstände behaupten müssen in dieser Welt. Und egal ob beim Klimaschutz, bei den Menschenrechten, bei Zukunftstechnologien oder in Fragen europäischer Sicherheit – wir spielen weiter im gleichen Team! […] Dieser Tage hört man gelegentlich, in den jetzt anstehenden Verhandlungen müsse Großbritannien abgestraft werden für seinen Austritt aus der Europäischen Union. Ich hielte das für einen großen Fehler. Wollten wir denjenigen schaden, die sich abwenden, dann würden wir am Ende weder die Briten bekehren, noch die restlichen Europäer überzeugen. Politisch klug und im besten britischen Sinn fair ist dagegen, die Verhandlungen so zu führen, dass sie der Europäischen Union nicht schaden. […] Was wir brauchen, sind neue, inklusive Formen der Zusammenarbeit – gerade in der Außen- und Sicherheitspolitik. Vor einigen Monaten habe ich deshalb einen Europäischen Sicherheitsrat vorgeschlagen, um uns dort über die strategischen Fragen europäischer Sicherheit abzustimmen. Um in Krisen schneller zu handeln. Und nicht zuletzt, um Großbritannien und die Europäische Union über den Brexit hinaus zusammenzuhalten. Mit Frankreich arbeiten wir daran, diese Idee so schnell wie möglich zu konkretisieren. Denn so legen wir ein Fundament für unser künftiges Verhältnis. „ You say Goodbye, I say Hello “, singen die Beatles in ihrem Song. Das Goodbye haben wir gut geregelt. Und sollte es sich doch irgendwann als ein „Auf Wiedersehen“ herausstellen: Für Euch ist immer Platz – an unserem Tisch in Brüssel und in unseren Herzen. Machen wir uns jetzt also ans Hello, an unsere Zukunft. Getrennt, aber gemeinsam.

The Titanic disaster The Belfast News Wednesday, 17th April 1912 TWO DAYS AFTER – MORE FACTS The giant ship Titanic, which was built here in Belfast’s shipyard, hit an iceberg on 14th April, shortly before midnight. Water filled the ship until it sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD’S LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship’s builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. LOCAL MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland. The ship’s doctor, Dr John Simpson, 37, was born in Belfast. His mother was optimistic when a letter from him arrived at her home yesterday. However, we have found out that he posted the letter during the ship’s last stop. We now know that Dr Simpson did not survive. DOG SAVES LIVES Some were lucky and the ships which came to save the passengers of the Titanic found their lifeboat. According to a passenger, one of the dogs on board saved the lives of the people in one lifeboat. A ship only found this lifeboat in the dark night and the foggy weather because they heard the dog when it barked. HOW COULD IT HAPPEN? After the sinking of the Titanic a number of questions still need answers. Why did no one see the iceberg? Why did the ship break? Why were there only 20 lifeboats for 2,200 people on board? Why did lifeboats leave the ship when they were not yet full? And how can we make sure that an accident like this will never happen again? About 700 people survived the accident. Some ships today have over 6,500 passengers and crew. After the Titanic’s accident there were laws that ships must have one lifeboat place for every person on board. Dr Simpson’s last letter to his mother is now in the Belfast Titanic museum. A deadly silence 1. My name is Jonas Fox and I’m twelve years old. I work in the mines and my job is to sit near a door in the tunnel every day. I must open the door when the coal arrives. Then, after it’s gone, I quickly close the door again. Every day I sit in the dark, but I’m never scared. That’s because my friend Billy is always there with me. Billy sings all day long. He’s yellow with little black eyes which look like they are made of glass. Billy is a canary, you see? It’s never boring with Billy around. I would love to sing too, but I can’t even talk. 2. Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine killed 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there’s gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine. One day Bart started to cough and he never stopped coughing after that. Then one night my brother coughed so badly that he died. That was when I stopped talking. I don’t know why, really. I still had words in my head and I opened my mouth, but I couldn’t speak. The men in the mine started to call me ‘Silent Jonas’ after that. They probably thought I was a bit strange. 4. The day when things got really bad started like any other. Billy was singing like he always did. I heard the people in the tunnels and the noise of the coal trucks. I opened the door and I felt a cold wind in the tunnel. I closed the door again. Billy stopped singing. For a moment I didn’t understand. But then, suddenly, I did: There was gas in the mine! And it could explode any second. I didn’t have time to run down the tunnel to warn the men. If only I could talk, if only I could shout! 5. I knew I had to during everyone in the mine. So I opened my mouth and tried to say it: “Gas.” But there was no sound. Nothing came out. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth again. Nothing. I panicked. We could die in here – I had to speak! I tried again. This time the sound was quiet, but I made a sound. At last! I opened the door and shouted, “Gas. Gas. GAS!” A moment later I heard the sound of the miners’ boots in the tunnels. I took Billy’s cage and ran too. 6. I ran through the tunnel as fast as I could. But my head hurt and I couldn’t breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn’t tell where it was coming from. “Come on, boy!” it said. Somebody picked me up. I turned around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy’s cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn’t just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, “Who warned us?” “Me!” I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. “Silent Jonas found his voice!” a miner shouted. But how could I feel happy? My friend Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small ‘Tweet’. Billy was alive! I opened the cage … There were canaries in mines until 1987. Today miners use machines to find out if there is gas in the mine. The Norman conquest The old king of England, Edward, died in 1066. He had no children and both his Anglo-Saxon brother-in-law, Harold, and his French cousin, William, Duke of Normandy, wanted to be the next king of England. Harold made himself king, and William was very angry. So what did he do next? He sailed to England with his army … Harold and William fought the battle on Senlac Hill, near Hastings. William’s men were knights and they were better trained. They fought on horses and were good archers. Harold’s men fought on foot and they were already tired from an earlier battle at Stamford Bridge, 200 miles away in the north of England. (Yes, they had to walk those 200 miles!) How do we know what happened warn the Battle of Hastings? Well, we have the 70-metre long Bayeux Tapestry to tell us! The tapestry is like a comic and it tells the story of the battle. It tells us that Harold died when he got an arrow in his eye, but we don’t know if this really happened. William won the Battle of Hastings and he became king of England on Christmas Day 1066. Today we know him as William the Conqueror. He was a big castle fan and built lots of them in England, including part of the Tower of London. He also took land from the Anglo-Saxons and gave it to his Norman friends. Did the Normans change England? Yes, of course they did! For example, they brought many new words to the English language. Words like ‘pork’ and ‘garden’ come from this time. Guess what? There are still many English people who have Norman surnames, like Archer or Darcy. Before the Normans came to England, most people didn’t even have surnames. They lived in small villages, so a first name or a nickname was often enough. ___ conquest – Eroberung ; the Anglo-Saxons – die Angelsachsen (das Volk, das schon vor 1066 in England lebte) ; brother-in-law – Schwager ; duke – Herzog ; army – Heer; Armee ; knight – Ritter ; archer – Bogenschütze; Bogenschützin ; tapestry – Wandteppich ; surname – Nachname; Familienname",,1518

Every day I sit in the dark, but I’m never scared. That’s because my friend Billy is always there with me. Billy sings all day long. He’s yellow with little black eyes which look like they are made of glass. Billy is a canary, you see? It’s never boring with Billy around. Wednesday, would love to sing too, but I can’t even talk. 2. Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine killed 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there’s gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine. One day Bart started to cough and he never stopped coughing after that. Then one night my brother coughed so badly that he died. That was when I stopped talking. I don’t know why, really. I still had words in my head and I opened my mouth, but I couldn’t speak. The men in the mine started to call me ‘Silent Jonas’ after that. They probably thought I was a bit strange. 4. The day when things got really bad started like any other. Billy was singing like he always did. I heard the people in the tunnels and the noise of the coal trucks. I opened the door and I felt a cold wind in the tunnel. I closed the door again. Billy stopped singing. For a moment I didn’t understand. But then, suddenly, I did: There was gas in the mine! And it could explode any second. I didn’t have time to run down the tunnel to warn the men. If only I could talk, if only I could shout! 5. I knew I had to warn everyone in the mine. So I opened my mouth and tried to say it: “Gas.” But there was no sound. Nothing came out. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth again. Nothing. I panicked. We could die in here – I had to speak! I tried again. This time the sound was quiet, but I made a sound. At last! I opened the door and shouted, “Gas. Gas. GAS!” A moment later I heard the sound of the miners’ boots in the tunnels. I took Billy’s cage and ran too. 6. I ran through the tunnel as fast as I could. But my head hurt and I couldn’t breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn’t tell where it was coming from. “Come on, boy!” it said. Somebody picked me up. I turned around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy’s cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn’t just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, “Who warned us?” “Me!” I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. “Silent Jonas found his voice!” a miner shouted. But how could I feel happy? My friend Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small ‘Tweet’. Billy was alive! I opened the cage … There were canaries in mines until 1987. Today miners use machines to find out if there is gas in the mine. The Norman conquest The old king of England, Edward, died in 1066. He had no children and both his Anglo-Saxon brother-in-law, Harold, and his French cousin, William, Duke of Normandy, wanted to be the next king of England. Harold made himself king, and William was very angry. So what did he do next? He sailed to England with his army … Harold and William fought the battle on Senlac Hill, near Hastings. William’s men were knights and they were better trained. They fought on horses and were good archers. Harold’s men fought on foot and they were already tired from an earlier battle at Stamford Bridge, 200 miles away in the north of England. (Yes, they had to walk those 200 miles!) How do we know what happened during the Battle of Hastings? Well, we have the 70-metre long Bayeux Tapestry to tell us! The tapestry is like a comic and it tells the story of the battle. It tells us that Harold died when he got an arrow in his eye, but we don’t know if this really happened. William won the Battle of Hastings and he became king of England on Christmas Day 1066. Today we know him as William the Conqueror. He was a big castle fan and built lots of them in England, including part of the Tower of London. He also took land from the Anglo-Saxons and gave it to his Norman friends. Did the Normans change England? Yes, of course they did! For example, they brought many new words to the English language. Words like ‘pork’ and ‘garden’ come from this time. Guess what? There are still many English people who have Norman surnames, like Archer or Darcy. Before the Normans came to England, most people didn’t even have surnames. They lived in small villages, so a first name or a nickname was often enough. ___ conquest – Eroberung ; the Anglo-Saxons – die Angelsachsen (das Volk, das schon vor 1066 in England lebte) ; brother-in-law – Schwager ; duke – Herzog ; army – Heer; Armee ; knight – Ritter ; archer – Bogenschütze; Bogenschützin ; tapestry – Wandteppich ; surname – Nachname; Familienname The RNLI: Volunteers on the coast The RNLI is the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. It’s a charity and it saves lives at sea. The RNLI has 237 lifeboat stations and about 4,600 crew members in the UK and Ireland. The RNLI rescues about 8,000 people per year. The RNLI has saved about 140,000 lives since 1824. Many of the lifeboat crew members are volunteers. The RNLI gets money from fundraising. 18th June 2016, by Simon Spade Yesterday the RNLI rescued two teenage boys who got into trouble when they were kayaking off the coast near Llandudno. The two 14-year-old boys went out too far in their kayaks and could not get back to the beach because of strong winds. They tried to get back for more than two and a half hours, then shouted for help and waved. A tourist spotted the boys and made an emergency call to the RNLI. The lifeboat crew left their station at 1:40 p.m. and got to the kayaks in only a few minutes. The RNLI crew picked up the boys and gave them blankets and hot drinks to keep them warm. Lifeboat helm Howard Link called the ambulance to meet them on the beach. Both boys were very weak and seasick. They both spent the night in Llandudno hospital but are back home now. The lifeboat crew got back to their station at 3:25 p.m. There are some rules to remember when you go to the beach: S pot the dangers. A lways go with a friend or adult. F ind and follow the safety signs and flags. E mergency – put up your hand and shout or call 999/112. Most lifeboat crew members are volunteers. Let’s meet some. Name: Howard Link Job: Postman Lifeboat helm: I lead the rescue. It is my job to make sure that everyone on the boat stays safe while we are at sea. Name: Susan Merchant Job: Teacher Lifeboat crew member: I grew up in Wales near the sea, so I have been in boats for many years. I help during the rescue and look after the rescued person. Name: John Taylor Job: Student Lifeboat youth volunteer: I’m only 16 so I’m too young to join the lifeboat crew, but I work at the station. I look after the equipment and help at fundraising events.

Bye Gwen, see you tomorrow.” Luke rushed down the stairs and got off the bus. He wanted to finish his game. He put his hand in his pocket, but his phone wasn’t there! “Oh no, I must have forgotten it on the bus!” He looked up. But the bus wasn’t there any more. Luke went home and phoned the bus company. They wanted to help but first they needed a special number from his phone – and he didn’t know the number! Luke didn’t enjoy his dinner at all that night. Why wasn’t he more careful with his phone? Suddenly the doorbell rang. “Gwen’s here!” shouted Luke’s mum from the hall. Luke went to the door. Gwen and her dad were there. “I heard something fall on the floor when you got off the bus,” said Gwen. “I asked a woman to see what it was.” Gwen gave Luke his phone. “Wow!” said Luke. “Today is my lucky day! Thanks, Gwen.” “That’s what friends are for!” said Gwen. “Come on, Gwen. Let’s get that pizza!” said Gwen’s dad. Luke put his phone in his pocket. It really was his lucky day.

I’m Robert, the leader for today’s walk. Can Shruti, Alejandro, Daniel and Maria come with me?” Four students got up and followed Robert. “We’re going to go hiking in the forest,” said Robert. “You should all have long trousers, good shoes, a hat and a bottle of water. Any questions?” “What about lunch?” asked Alejandro. “There’s a packed lunch with sandwiches, fruit and a cake,” answered Robert. “Do I need my GPS 1 map?” asked Maria. “It’s the New Forest, not the Amazon jungle 2 !” said Shruti. “I’ve got a map, but you can take yours too,” said Robert. Maria smiled. 12:34 p.m.: In the forest “When is lunch?” asked Shruti. “We’re going to stop at the picnic spot 3 ,” said Robert. “How far is that?” asked Shruti. “It’s on my map,” said Robert. He looked in his bag as 4 he walked. Suddenly Robert tripped. He fell down a bank and into a small river. His bag opened, and all the sandwiches went into the river. The students ran down to him. “Are you OK?” asked Alejandro. “It’s my ankle,” said Robert. “I think it’s broken.” Maria and Daniel pulled Robert out of the river. Alejandro held his leg as they moved him. Then Shruti took out her phone. “What are we going to do? We don’t know where we are, and there’s no signal!” she said. “I know first aid 5 . I can look after Robert until we get help,” said Alejandro. “And I can use my GPS to find out where we are,” said Maria. Alejandro looked at Robert’s ankle and Daniel gave him some water. Shruti didn’t know what to do. She felt bad. “Come here, Shruti. You can help me,” said Maria. “We need someone to run and get help, and you can run fast.” “Where should I go?” Shruti asked excitedly. “Look at my GPS,” said Maria. “There’s a hill about two miles from here. You can get a signal at the top of it. Run there and call the emergency services.” “Good luck, Shruti!” said Alejandro as Shruti started to run. 2:00 p.m.: In the forest “Where’s Shruti? I hope she’s OK,” said Alejandro. “Robert needs help soon.” Robert was in a lot of pain 6 . Suddenly they heard a noise. “It’s a helicopter!” said Maria. The helicopter landed and soon Shruti arrived with two paramedics. “Well done, Shruti!” said Alejandro. “Thank you. And thank you, Maria, for knowing where to go,” Shruti said.

Luke and Gwen were on the bus. “Dad said we can get a takeaway pizza tonight,” said Gwen. “I love tuna pizza. What’s your favourite pizza, Luke?” Luke didn’t answer. “Did you hear me?” asked Gwen. “Sorry. I’m playing this game on my phone,” said Luke. “I have a really high score. Look!” “I can’t see that,” said Gwen. “Sorry. I forgot you have a problem with your eyes,” said Luke. “You forgot Dave’s birthday. You forgot your homework. You forget everything,” said Gwen. “No, I don’t,” said Luke. He looked out of the window. “Oh no! This is my stop. I forgot where we are! Bye Gwen, see you tomorrow.” Luke rushed down the stairs and got off the bus. He wanted to finish his game. He put his hand in his pocket, but his phone wasn’t there! “Oh no, I must have forgotten it on the bus!” He looked up. But the bus wasn’t there any more. Luke went home and phoned the bus company. They wanted to help but first they needed a special number from his phone – and he didn’t know the number! Luke didn’t enjoy his dinner at all that night. Why wasn’t he more careful with his phone? Suddenly the doorbell rang. “Gwen’s here!” shouted Luke’s mum from the hall. Luke went to the door. Gwen and her dad were there. “I heard something fall on the floor when you got off the bus,” said Gwen. “I asked a woman to see what it was.” Gwen gave Luke his phone. “Wow!” said Luke. “Today is my lucky day! Thanks, Gwen.” “That’s what friends are for!” said Gwen. “Come on, Gwen. Let’s get that pizza!” said Gwen’s dad. Luke put his phone in his pocket. It really was his lucky day. Maybe he could get his best ever high score too. How I won a prize The TV show ‘Teen chef of the year’ tries to find the UK’s best young chef. Twenty-four kids took part in the competition this year. They cooked lots of different meals for the judges – three chefs. The kids also answered many questions about food. At the end of the competition one kid was the winner – and that kid was me! My name is Joe Reedman. My entry form for the show: Entry form: Teen chef of the year Age: ‬13 Favourite food: scrambled eggs Favourite meal: breakfast Why I started: When I was six, I watched my mum in the kitchen. She was making a cake. The eggs, milk and flour became a delicious cake and it was like magic. I wanted to do magic cooking too!

London is the place for me! Old woman I don’t think so. It’s an awful place. (Dora looks down the road. There is the sound of a bus.) Dora Here’s my bus. Oh … and my name’s Dora White. Remember that name, because you’ll hear it again 2 when I’m famous. (Dora takes her bag. The old woman shakes her head. The lights go down 3 .) Narrator When Dora arrives in London, she gets a job. (Dora is in a busy restaurant kitchen. She is doing the washing up 4 . A chef and a waiter are in the kitchen. There are dirty plates, glasses and pots next to Dora.) Waiter I need six plates and glasses now! Dora One moment, please. Chef Work faster. I need three clean pots now. Dora Yes, chef. Chef Where are they? I need them now! Dora You can have them in a minute. I’m busy with these plates. (Dora gives the plates to the waiter.) Waiter These plates are dirty! Dora I’m sorry! Chef You are useless! Dora No, I’m not. Chef You can go, Nora! Never come back! Dora It’s not Nora. It’s Dora. Dora White. Remember that name, because you’ll hear it again when I’m famous. (Dora exits the stage 5 on the right.

We need kitchen workers for our very special restaurant. We are a friendly restaurant, but you must be hard-working and determined. (Dora smiles and stands up straight. There is the sound of a bus.) Bus driver (From off the stage 6 , on the left) Do you want to get on? This is the last bus to Aldham today. Dora No thanks. I want to stay here. London is the place for me. (A young woman walks past Dora.) Dora Excuse me. Can you tell me the way to the Three Lions Hotel, please? Young woman The Three Lions Hotel? Yes, of course. Go straight on. It’s on the right.

I want to be with my friends. But I’m not. Mum and Dad sent me to stay with Aunt Susan for six long days. To a village! In the middle of nowhere. All you can see are fields, trees and some animals. There are no shops, no cafés and no buses. No skate park either! It’s so boring! How can people live here? There was a party in the village this evening. But it wasn’t fun. There was a barbecue 1 and then singing and dancing. But the music was awful. I was so bored that I turned their music off and played some hip-hop 2 instead. Everybody was mad and shouted at me. I laughed at them and left. I hate this place and I hate these people. How can birds be so loud? Some of them started singing at four in the morning! Later the church bells 3 rang 4 . Nothing happened today. Just another boring day. When can I go home? Nothing! Aunt Susan wanted me to help with the cows and in the garden, but I stayed in my room and watched films. The village boys tried to pick me up for a football game. I told them that I didn’t have my football shoes and couldn’t play. I can’t believe what happened last night. I woke up in the middle of the night because there was a loud noise in the house. I went to the kitchen and saw Aunt Susan there. She was on the phone, and she was very excited. When she saw me, she told me to come with her. Rosalie needed help. I didn’t know who Rosalie was. I was surprised when I saw that Rosalie was one of Aunt Susan’s cows. She needed help with her calf. Some other people from the village were there too. They were all very calm and knew what to do. They told me to hold the light so that the vet could see well. I could hardly look. That noise! And it smelt terrible. Yuck! 5 Then it was there. A little calf. So sweet, so clumsy. We all felt very happy. I was so tired but so excited. I got up early again. I just had to see if the calf was OK. It was. It stood next to Rosalie and drank its milk. It’s the most beautiful little cow I’ve ever seen 6 . I think I’ll ask Aunt Susan if I can come back again.

He looked in his bag as 4 he walked. Suddenly Robert tripped. He fell down a bank and into a small river. His bag opened, and all the sandwiches went into the river. The students ran down to him. “Are you OK?” asked Alejandro. “It’s my ankle,” said Robert. “I think it’s broken.” Maria and Daniel pulled Robert out of the river. Alejandro held his leg as they moved him. Then Shruti took out her phone. “What are we going to do? We don’t know where we are, and there’s no signal!” she said. “I know first aid 5 . I can look after Robert until we get help,” said Alejandro. “And I can use my GPS to find out where we are,” said Maria. Alejandro looked at Robert’s ankle and Daniel gave him some water. Shruti didn’t know what to do. She felt bad. “Come here, Shruti. You can help me,” said Maria. “We need someone to run and get help, and you can run fast.” “Where should I go?” Shruti asked excitedly. “Look at my GPS,” said Maria. “There’s a hill about two miles from here. You can get a signal at the top of it. Run there and call the emergency services.” “Good luck, Shruti!” said Alejandro as Shruti started to run. 2:00 p.m.: In the forest “Where’s Shruti? I hope she’s OK,” said Alejandro. “Robert needs help soon.” Robert was in a lot of pain 6 . Suddenly they heard a noise. “It’s a helicopter!” said Maria.

What was it like on the lifeboat? The Titanic disaster The Belfast News Wednesday, 17th April 1912 TWO DAYS AFTER – MORE FACTS The giant ship Titanic, which was built here in Belfast’s shipyard, hit an iceberg on 14th April, shortly before midnight. Water filled the ship until it sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD’S LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship’s builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 6,500 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. LOCAL MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland.

Dr Simpson’s last letter to his mother is now in the Belfast Titanic museum. A deadly silence 1. My name is Jonas Fox and I’m twelve years old. I work in the mines and my job is to sit near a door in the tunnel every day. I must open the door when the coal arrives. Then, after it’s gone, I quickly close the door again. Every day I sit in the dark, but I’m never scared. That’s because my friend Billy is always there with me. Billy sings all day long. He’s yellow with little black eyes which look like they are made of glass. Billy is a canary, you see? It’s never boring with Billy around. I would love to sing too, but I can’t even talk. 2. Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine killed 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there’s gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine. One day Bart started to cough and he never stopped coughing after that. Then one night my brother coughed so badly that he died. That was when I stopped talking. I don’t know why, really. I still had words in my head and I opened my mouth, but I couldn’t speak. The men in the mine started to call me ‘Silent Jonas’ after that. They probably thought I was a bit strange. 4. The day when things got really bad started like any other. Billy was singing like he always did. I heard the people in the tunnels and the noise of the coal trucks. I opened the door and I felt a cold wind in the tunnel. I closed the door again. Billy stopped singing. For a moment I didn’t understand. But then, suddenly, I did: There was gas in the mine! And it could explode any second. I didn’t have time to run down the tunnel to warn the men. If only I could talk, if only I could shout! 5. I knew I had to warn everyone in the mine. So I opened my mouth and tried to say it: “Gas.” But there was no sound. Nothing came out. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth again. Nothing. I panicked. We could die in here – I had to speak! I tried again. This time the sound was quiet, but I made a sound. At last! I opened the door and shouted, “Gas. Gas. GAS!” A moment later I heard the sound of the miners’ boots in the tunnels. I took Billy’s cage and ran too. 6. I ran through the tunnel as fast as I could. But my head hurt and I couldn’t breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn’t tell where it was coming from. “Come on, boy!” it said. Somebody picked me up. I friend around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy’s cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn’t just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, “Who warned us?” “Me!” I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. “Silent Jonas found his voice!” a miner shouted. But how could I feel happy? My turned Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small ‘Tweet’. Billy was alive! I opened the cage … There were canaries in mines until 1987. Today miners use machines to find out if there is gas in the mine.",,1165

Man’s life is independent. He is born not for the development of the society alone, but for the development of his self. ___ B. R. Ambedkar, former Indian Minister of Law and Justice The House on Mango Street My name In English my name means hope. In Spanish it means too many letters. It means sadness, it means waiting. It is like the number nine. A muddy color. It is the Mexican records my father plays on Sunday mornings when he is shaving, songs like sobbing. It was my great-grandmother’s name and now it is mine. She was a horse woman too, born like me in the Chinese year of the horse – which is supposed 1 to be bad luck if you’re born female – but I think this is a Chinese lie because the Chinese, like the Mexicans, don’t like their women strong. My great-grandmother. I would’ve liked to have known her, a wild horse of a woman, so wild she wouldn’t marry. Until my great-grandfather threw a sack over her head and carried her off. Just like that, as if she were a fancy chandelier 2 . That’s the way he did it. And the story goes she never forgave him. She looked out the window her whole life, the way so many women sit their sadness on an elbow. I wonder if she made the best with what she got or was she sorry because she couldn’t be all the things she wanted to be. Esperanza. I have inherited her name, but I don’t want to inherit her place by the window. At school they say my name funny as if the syllables were made out of tin and hurt the roof of your mouth. But in Spanish my name is made out of a softer something, like silver, not quite as thick as my sister’s name – Magdalena – which is uglier than mine. Magdalena who at least can come home and become Nenny. But I am always Esperanza. I would like to baptize 3 myself under a new name, a name more like the real me, the one nobody sees.

It grins or sneers to show it is excited or afraid. It campaign its lips together if it wants to impress another chimp. When it plays, a chimp generally has an open smile with its top teeth covered. Apart from its face, a chimp also uses body language to communicate. For example, its hair stands on end when it is excited. That reaction can also mean that it is afraid. When it is aggressive, it usually raises its arms or hits the ground and stares at another animal. A chimp normally produces more than 15 different types of call. For example, there is a special identification margin call that will help its family find it. When chimps play, they often make a sound similar to our laughter. Body contact is very important for preserving harmony in a group of chimpanzees. That is why chimpanzees often groom each other for hours. It helps them stay calm and creates feelings of friendship.

So I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip. I give Pirrip as my father's family name, on the authority of his tombstone and my sister — Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith. As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness of either of them (for their days were long before the days of photographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like were unreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on my father's gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man with curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription, ""also Georgiana wife of the above,"" I drew a childish conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly. To five little pit lozenges, each about a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside their grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of mine—who gave up trying to get a living exceedingly early in that universal struggle — I am indebted for a belief I religiously entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands in their trowsers-pockets, and had never submit them out in this state of existence.

Find more information about the product here: digione.ch Why I love Edinburgh I first visited Edinburgh as a child with my parents and my sister. I thought it was a magical city with a very special atmosphere. It’s small enough to get around easily and not feel lost, but big enough that there’s a lot to do. So after I left field school, I decided to go to university there. It was a good decision – I had a wonderful time! The locals were really friendly and after some time I even started to understand the Edinburgh accent. In fact, I loved Edinburgh so much that I stayed after university. At first I lived and worked in the city, but after I met my husband (who is a true Scotsman!) we motivate to the countryside nearby. I work from home now as I have my own business. But I love to drive to the city at the weekend in my Mini. Last week my parents came to stay and we visited Edinburgh Castle and the Scottish National Gallery. One day we took the children to the zoo, and another day we took a boat out to Inchcolm Abbey on a nearby island. Most days we had a picnic lunch in the Princes Street Gardens.I love that there are so many different things to do in Edinburgh. This city really has become my home now.

1542,3s6tMlF9an06LNiCLaTENK_SR,eng,"Read the following text and answer the question below: A chimpanzee uses its face to express different feelings. It grins or sneers to show it is excited or afraid. It presses its lips together if it wants to impress another chimp. When it plays, a chimp generally has an open smile with its top teeth covered. Apart from its face, a chimp also uses body language to communicate. For example, its hair stands on end when it is excited. That reaction can also mean that it is afraid. When it is aggressive, it usually raises its arms or hits the ground and stares at another animal. A chimp normally produces more than 15 different types of call. For example, there is a special identification call that will help its family retrieve it. When chimps play, they often make a sound similar to our laughter. Body liaison is very important for preserving harmony in a group of chimpanzees. That is why chimpanzees often groom each other for hours. It helps them stay calm and creates feelings of friendship.

They decide to go on a trip to find the boy’s body and prepare for the trip. The Gun My room was on the second floor, and it was really hot up there. I was glad I wasn’t sleeping there that night, and the thought of where we were going made me excited again. I rolled up two blankets and tied an old belt around them. I grabbed all my money, which was less than a dollar. Then I was ready to go. I went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad. I was walking up Carbine Street towards the clubhouse when Chris caught up with me. His eyes were shining. “Gordie! You want to see something?” “Sure. What?” “Come down here first.” He pointed down an alley between two shops. “What is it, Chris?” “Come on, I said!” He ran down the alley and I ran after him. At the bottom, the smell from the trash was terrible. “Chris, I’m going to puke, I’m – ” But I forgot about the smell when Chris put his hand into his backpack and pulled out a big gun. “Where did you get that?” “From my dad’s desk.” “Man, your dad’s going to beat you when he finds out.” Chris’s eyes just went on dancing. “He isn’t going to find out. He and his friends have got enough wine to keep them drunk for a week. I’ll put it back before then.” Chris hated alcohol – he’d already seen too much of what it can do. He was the only one of us who didn’t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they’d stolen from their father. “Have you got bullets for it?” “Nine of them – all that was left in the box. He’ll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.” “Any in it at the moment?” “No, of course not. What do you think I am?” I finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA – BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin – it was the work of an evil magician. “Wow!” I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn’t tell if he was amused or scared. “You did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!” “Shut up! Let’s go!” I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. “Man, it’s a pity you couldn’t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.” “You knew there was a bullet in it, didn’t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.” “I didn’t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad’s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.” Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, “What do you think we need a gun for?” “Nothing, really,” Chris said. “Except we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it’s frightening out in the forest at night.” Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?” Teddy asked Vern. “Yeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it’ll look as if we’re there after dark.” “Hey, man, great!” I said, and slapped Vern on the back.

He grinned. “So let’s go,” Teddy said. “It’s nearly twelve already.” Chris stood up and we gathered round him. “We’ll walk across Beeman’s field,” he said, “and then we’ll get to the railway raceway and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.” “How far is it, do you think?” Teddy asked. “I don’t know,” said Chris. “Harlow’s big.

Maybe more – thirty miles.” “Come on, you guys,” Chris said, and picked up his backpack, blankets and water bottle.",,899

Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? headline written by Pam Warner (published 07/12/16 in Health & Style ) author, date, source What is your Thanksgiving like? Turkey and pumpkin pie? American football on the sofa? In the last couple of years a new trend has become popular in the USA: More people like to eat better quality food and live a more active life. introduction It is slowly going out of fashion to live off convenience and frozen food. A number of people shop for organic food at special supermarkets instead. In some states farmers’ markets offer a great variety of fresh vegetables and fruit from the region. “There are also dairy products, bread and meat without chemical additives at these markets. Organic food is not only much healthier but it tastes a lot better as well,” explains Emma from Boston. So how about some healthy recipes for Thanksgiving? Maybe pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes? A roast turkey breast or a turkey roulade filled with apples and cranberries is delicious too. But there’s more to a healthy lifestyle than just food. A lot of trend sports show that you can have fun, spend time with friends and stay fit at the same time. Have you found the right sport for you yet? If not, here is a suggestion: How about standup paddleboarding? If you like water, that’s the ideal kind of sport for you. You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don’t worry, you don’t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcoholic beverage and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: “Drinking too much alcoholic beverage isn’t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?” Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don’t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion",,1413

In the last couple of years a new trend has become popular in the USA: More people like to eat better quality food and live a more active life. introduction It is slowly going out of fashion to live off convenience and frozen food. A number of people shop for organic food at special supermarkets instead. In some states farmers’ markets offer a great variety of fresh vegetables and fruit from the region. “There are also dairy products, bread and meat without chemical additives at these markets. Organic food is not only much healthier but it tastes a lot better as well,” explains Emma from Boston. So how about some healthy recipes for Thanksgiving? Maybe pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes? A roast turkey breast or a turkey roulade filled with apples and cranberries is delicious too. But there’s more to a healthy lifestyle than just food. A lot of trend sports show that you can have fun, spend time with friends and stay fit at the same time. Have you found the right sport for you yet? If not, here is a suggestion: How about standup paddleboarding? If you like water, that’s the ideal kind of sport for you. You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don’t worry, you don’t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: “Drinking too much alcohol isn’t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?” Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don’t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion",,1342

They decide to go on a trip to find the boy’s body and prepare for the trip. The Gun My room was on the second floor, and it was really hot up there. I was glad I wasn’t sleeping there that night, and the thought of where we were going made me excited again. I rolled up two blankets and tied an old belt around them. I grabbed all my money, which was less than a dollar. Then I was ready to go. I went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad. I was walking up Carbine Street towards the clubhouse when Chris caught up with me. His eyes were shining. “Gordie! You want to see something?” “Sure. What?” “Come down here first.” He pointed down an alley between two shops. “What is it, Chris?” “Come on, I said!” He ran down the alley and I ran after him. At the bottom, the smell from the trash was terrible. “Chris, I’m going to puke, I’m – ” But I forgot about the smell when Chris put his hand into his backpack and pulled out a cock a hoop gun. “Where did you get that?” “From my dad’s desk.” “Man, your dad’s going to beat you when he finds out.” Chris’s eyes just went on dancing. “He isn’t going to find out. He and his friends have got enough wine to keep them drunk for a week. I’ll put it back before then.” Chris hated alcohol – he’d already seen too much of what it can do. He was the only one of us who didn’t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they’d stolen from their father. “Have you got bullets for it?” “Nine of them – all that was left in the box. He’ll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.” “Any in it at the moment?” “No, of course not. What do you think I am?” I finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA – BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A cock a hoop hole appeared in the tin – it was the work of an evil magician. “Wow!” I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn’t tell if he was amused or scared. “You did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!” “Shut up! Let’s go!” I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. “Man, it’s a pity you couldn’t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.” “You knew there was a bullet in it, didn’t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.” “I didn’t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad’s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.” Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, “What do you think we need a gun for?” “Nothing, really,” Chris said. “Except we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it’s frightening out in the forest at night.” Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?” Teddy asked Vern. “Yeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it’ll look as if we’re there after dark.” “Hey, man, great!” I said, and slapped Vern on the back. For him, that was real thinking. He grinned. “So let’s go,” Teddy said. “It’s nearly twelve already.” Chris stood up and we gathered round him. “We’ll walk across Beeman’s field,” he said, “and then we’ll get to the railway tracks and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.” “How far is it, do you think?” Teddy asked. “I don’t know,” said Chris. “Harlow’s big. We’re going to have to walk at least twenty miles. Does that sound right to you, Gordie?” “Yeah. Maybe more – thirty miles.” “Come on, you guys,” Chris said, and picked up his backpack, blankets and water bottle. Healthy and active at Thanksgiving?

They decide to go on a trip to find the boy’s body and prepare for the trip. The Gun My room was on the second floor, and it was really hot up there. I was glad I wasn’t sleeping there that night, and the thought of where we were going made me excited again. I rolled up two blankets and tied an old belt around them. I grabbed all my money, which was less than a dollar. Then I was ready to go. I went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad. I was walking up Carbine Street towards the clubhouse when Chris caught up with me. His eyes were shining. “Gordie! You want to see something?” “Sure. What?” “Come down here first.” He pointed down an alley between two shops. “What is it, Chris?” “Come on, I said!” He ran down the alley and I ran after him. At the bottom, the smell from the trash was terrible. “Chris, I’m going to puke, I’m – ” But I forgot about the smell when Chris put his hand into his backpack and pulled out a big gun. “Where did you get that?” “From my dad’s desk.” “Man, your dad’s going to beat you when he finds out.” Chris’s eyes just went on dancing. “He isn’t going to find out. He and his friends have got enough wine to keep them drunk for a week. I’ll put it back before then.” Chris hated alcohol – he’d already seen too much of what it can do. He was the only one of us who didn’t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they’d stolen from their father. “Have you got bullets for it?” “Nine of them – all that was pass on in the box. He’ll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.” “Any in it at the moment?” “No, of course not. What do you think I am?” I finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA – BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin – it was the work of an evil magician. “Wow!” I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn’t tell if he was amused or scared. “You did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!” “Shut up! Let’s go!” I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. “Man, it’s a pity you couldn’t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.” “You knew there was a bullet in it, didn’t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.” “I didn’t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad’s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.” Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, “What do you think we need a gun for?” “Nothing, really,” Chris said. “Except we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it’s frightening out in the forest at night.” Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?” Teddy asked Vern. “Yeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it’ll look as if we’re there after dark.” “Hey, man, great!” I said, and slapped Vern on the back. For him, that was real thinking. He grinned. “So let’s go,” Teddy said. “It’s nearly twelve already.” Chris stood up and we gathered round him. “We’ll walk across Beeman’s field,” he said, “and then we’ll get to the railway tracks and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.” “How far is it, do you think?” Teddy asked. “I don’t know,” said Chris. “Harlow’s big. We’re going to have to walk at least twenty miles. Does that sound right to you, Gordie?” “Yeah. Maybe more – thirty miles.” “Come on, you guys,” Chris said, and picked up his backpack, blankets and water bottle. Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? headline written by Pam Warner (published 07/12/16 in Health & Style ) author, date, source What is your Thanksgiving like? Turkey and pumpkin pie? American football on the sofa? In the last couple of years a new trend has become popular in the USA: More people like to eat better quality food and live a more active life. introduction It is slowly going out of fashion to live off convenience and frozen food. A number of people shop for organic food at special supermarkets instead. In some states farmers’ markets offer a great variety of fresh vegetables and fruit from the region. “There are also dairy products, bread and meat without chemical additives at these markets. Organic food is not only much healthier but it tastes a lot better as well,” explains Emma from Boston. So how about some healthy recipes for Thanksgiving? Maybe pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes? A roast turkey breast or a turkey roulade filled with apples and cranberries is delicious too. But there’s more to a healthy lifestyle than just food. A lot of trend sports show that you can have fun, spend time with friends and stay fit at the same time. Have you found the right sport for you yet? If not, here is a suggestion: How about standup paddleboarding? If you like water, that’s the ideal kind of sport for you. You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don’t worry, you don’t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: “Drinking too much alcohol isn’t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?” Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don’t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion A first date Dylan often thought about Abby. He really liked her.

But there’s a strong community of Cubans here in New York. So my parents opened a small shop for other immigrants. Interviewer And how did you feel? José At the beginning I was homesick. I missed my friends. But my parents had given up a lot for me and I slowly got used to my new life. Interviewer When did you begin your baseball career?

Too young to work? many big farms in California employ children, mostly from Latin America, to pick fruit or vegetables. Children have to help their parents earn their living because migrant parents often don’t have enough income. It is difficult for them to get a better job because many of them don’t have many qualifications or can hardly speak English. Some are even in the USA illegally. All laborers have the legal right to take breaks and get water to drink in the state of California. But in reality things are different. Fresno Weekly Magazine talked to Matteo (12) and his brother Ramon (14) from Sacramento, who have been working on different farms. Fresno Weekly What are the working conditions like for you? Matteo We have to get up at 4:30 in the morning. Buses drive us to the fields, where we work all day in the heat. We sometimes work more than ten hours a day and only earn the minimum wage or even less. The long hours in the fields make you tired. Fresno Weekly Ramon, how long have you been working in the fields? Ramon Since I was ten, just like my Dad. Fresno Weekly Do you have any health problems? Ramon Yes, because of the pesticides I always have difficulty breathing and I have a constant headache out there. But that’s not all. Some people get injured working with the large machines. A federal law from 1938 allows farm owners to employ children from the age of twelve on big farms and even younger children on small farms. From the age of 14 teenagers can do farm work without their parents’ consent. Officially, they are only allowed to work outside school hours, but some of them don’t even finish high school. There are no statistics about how many children spend their days as farm helpers, but the estimate is about half a million. All recent attempts to change the law have failed.",,2070

Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is too a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy – after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world’s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren’t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is ‘fracking’, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, “Fracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.” But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada’s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. “We haven’t seen the end of this yet,” says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. “CO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have too destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.” 3. There is too another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven’t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They enunciate that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won’t change. “What worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,” he adds. “It will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.” Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable – which means that when we have used them up, there simply won’t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada’s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often too affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better – and we will have to.",,785

The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn’t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship’s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. police chief Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the ‘northwest passage’, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn’t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship’s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It’s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn’t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we’d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn’t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn’t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back’s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can’t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let’s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I’m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown. Stephen Samuel Stanley – ship’s doctor, HMS Erebus",,2175

We can do even better – by Lindsay Fern (21/1/2017) 1. Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable free energy – after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world’s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren’t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is ‘fracking’, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on free energy technology, explains, “Fracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.” But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of free energy too. Most of Canada’s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. “We haven’t seen the end of this yet,” says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. “CO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.” 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven’t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won’t change. “What worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,” he adds. “It will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.” Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable – which means that when we have used them up, there simply won’t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada’s free energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of free energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal free energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable free energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better – and we will have to. The sound of ice I’m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice.

It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better – and we will have to. The sound of ice I’m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn’t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from rockwell kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship’s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the ‘northwest passage’, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn’t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship’s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It’s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn’t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we’d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn’t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn’t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back’s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can’t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let’s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I’m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown.

(a.lal@vii.com) My name is Emma De Santis. I’m from Germany and I’m 18 years old. I took part in a project at an orphanage in Jaipur last year. My English isn’t bad and I used to work as a babysitter for our neighbours’ kids. I could choose to work from four weeks to ten months. I decided to stay for eight weeks. Before I went to India, I had to get all the important papers. I also knew that I would have to pay the organization almost €2,000. The flight was not included. So I decided to work in a supermarket to earn the money. When I got the contract for the project in India, I booked my flight and I was ready to go. When I arrived in Jaipur, I was very tired from the journey and the time difference. The heat, the noise and the smells made it even worse. But I still remember a cow lying in front of the phone shop. During the orientation days I met other volunteers from different countries, which was great. After that I met my host family. They were very friendly people. However, I was homesick during the first days, and I had some problems with the food. It was so spicy. At the time I thought, “If I don’t feel better soon, I’ll have to quit.” But I got over it quickly. My job was great but challenging too. The working conditions were OK. I was teaching 10-year-old girls English and organizing some free-time activities for the younger ones. The staff were very helpful. They all spoke English, which made things a little easier. I quickly found out that things are different in India. most people’s attitude in India is “Whatever happens, happens.” And usually that’s OK for everyone. Wherever I went, people were smiling at me. But they didn’t just show interest in me, many of them actually stared at me. But you learn to ignore it. I can really recommend taking part in a project like this. I met wonderful people, made new friends and learned a lot about myself. If you go to India, you’ll never forget it.",,2579
1596,6BKtN5ZByiq6CALJjrLthp_SR,eng,"What do you find most interesting about Martin Luther King, Jr.’s life? We can do even better – by Lindsay Fern (21/1/2017) 1. Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy – after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world’s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren’t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is ‘fracking’, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, “Fracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.” But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada’s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. “We haven’t seen the end of this yet,” says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. “CO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.” 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven’t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won’t change. “What worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,” he adds. “It will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.” Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable – which means that when we have used them up, there simply won’t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada’s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too.

If you go to India, you’ll never forget it. ‘I have a dream’ - Martin Luther King, Jr. On April 4, 1968 the African-American minister 1 and US civil rights 2 leader Martin Luther King, Junior was shot in Memphis, Tennessee. The week after his death there were violent protests in cities across the United States. But who was this man whose death shook both a nation and also people around the rest of the world? King was born in the American South, in Atlanta, Georgia, on January 15, 1929. He grew up in a religious family. His father was a Baptist pastor and his mother was a church organist. At that time the people in the American South were segregated 3 . Laws made sure that in the Southern states African-American people did not have the same rights as whites. They had to go to different schools and eat in different restaurants. They weren’t allowed to work with white people. African Americans had to sit at the back of buses and give up their seats to white people. King never wanted to accept this segregation. When he was little, his best friend was a white boy. King, however, had to go to a school for African Americans, while his friend went to a school for whites. So King lost his friend. Over the years King realized how unfair his family and neighbors were treated. He wanted to fight for the civil rights of African Americans. At the age of 18 King decided to become a minister. He felt that the church could give him the best chance to help people and society. He finished college in 1951. He got married to his girlfriend Coretta Scott in 1953, and together they had four children. A year later he became pastor of a Baptist church in Montgomery, Alabama. Protests against racial segregation began in 1955. African-American Rosa Parks hadn’t wanted to give up her bus seat to white people in the city of Montgomery. Rosa Parks was arrested. King started a campaign 4 . For 381 days people didn’t use the city’s public transportation. The campaign was led by Martin Luther King, Jr. During this time his house was bombed and he was arrested too. In the end racial segregation on all Montgomery public transportation was made illegal 5 . It was the first victory 6 for the Civil Rights Movement and it made King a very famous person. In 1957 King and other civil rights activists founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). They wanted to use non-violent protests to achieve 7 civil rights reform. King was influenced by Mahatma Gandhi and his successful non-violent protest against the British Empire in the 1940s. The SCLC started a campaign against racial segregation in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963. Everything was peaceful until the police used water cannons and police dogs against the protesters, even against children. When this was shown on national TV, many white Americans were shocked. The Birmingham campaign was successful and African Americans now had more access 8 to public places. ‘White Only’ and ‘Black Only’ signs were removed from restrooms 9 , for example. Early in the Birmingham campaign, King had been arrested again. In his cell he realized that freedom for African-American people would be a long and hard struggle 10 . Later that year King helped organize the March on Washington on August 28, 1963. Its goal was to protest against the way African Americans were treated in Southern states. The protesters wanted an end to racial segregation in schools and at work. They also wanted to protect workers from police brutality. More than 250,000 people joined the march. At the time it was the largest meeting of protesters in the history of Washington, D.C. During this event King gave his most famous speech – ‘I have a dream’. It became one of the greatest American speeches. Soon after, civil rights became the most important goal for black and white reformers in the United States. Most of the civil rights became law in 1964 and 1965. King got the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 for his role in the Civil Rights Movement. He was also named ‘Person of the Year’ by Time magazine. In March 1968 King went to Memphis, Tennessee. He wanted to support African-American workers there who were on strike 11 against bad working conditions. On April 4, 1968 he was shot. James Earl Ray, a white escaped convict 12 , was arrested and was sentenced 13 to 99 years in prison. Since 1983 the third Monday in January has become a national holiday 14 in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. The house where King was born and his grave in Atlanta are national monuments. Streets in towns and cities all over the United States have been named after him. King was the leader of the Civil Rights Movement for almost 13 years. During that time African Americans made a lot of progress on the way towards equality 15 in America. However, many black Americans still experience racial discrimination today. King is known as one of the greatest non-violent leaders in world history. ___ 1 minister [ˈmɪnɪstə] − Pfarrer, Pfarrerin ; 2 civil rights [ˌsɪvl ˈraɪts] − Bürgerrechte ; 3 segregated [ˈsegrɪgeɪtɪd] − getrennt (nach Hautfarbe) ; 4 campaign [kӕˈpeɪn] − Kampagne, Aktion ; 5 illegal [ɪˈli:gl] − illegal, gesetzeswidrig ; 6 victory [ˈvɪktri] − Sieg ; 7 to achieve [əˈt∫i:v] − erreichen ; 8 access [ˈӕkses] − Zugang, Zutritt ; 9 restroom [ˈrestˌrʊm] − Toilette ; 10 struggle [ˈstrʌgl] − Kampf ; 11 to be on strike [ɒn ˈstraɪk] − streiken ; 12 escaped convict [ɪˌskeɪpd ˈkɒnvɪkt] − flüchtiger Sträfling ; 13 to sentence [ˈsentəns] − verurteilen ; 14 national holiday [ˌnӕ∫nl ˈhɒlədeɪ] − (nationaler) Feiertag ; 15 equality [ɪˈkwɒləti] − Gleichheit",,3536

Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy – after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world’s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren’t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is ‘fracking’, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used.

But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. “We haven’t seen the end of this yet,” says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. “CO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.” 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven’t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won’t change. “What worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,” he adds. “It will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.” Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable – which means that when we have used them up, there simply won’t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada’s energy came from water power.

Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn’t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship’s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the ‘northwest passage’, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn’t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship’s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It’s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn’t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we’d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn’t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn’t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back’s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can’t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let’s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I’m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown. Stephen Samuel Stanley – ship’s doctor, HMS Erebus In New Zealand Working in India Get to know India and work as a volunteer Teaching young children in an orphanage in Jaipur Building and repairing schools in Goa Helping stray dogs in Ranchi For more information contact Mrs Lal. (a.lal@vii.com) My name is Emma De Santis. I’m from Germany and I’m 18 years old. I took part in a project at an orphanage in Jaipur last year. My English isn’t bad and I used to work as a babysitter for our neighbours’ kids. I could choose to work from four weeks to ten months. I decided to stay for eight weeks. Before I went to India, I had to get all the important papers. I also knew that I would have to pay the organization almost €2,000. The flight was not included. So I decided to work in a supermarket to earn the money. When I got the contract for the project in India, I booked my flight and I was ready to go. When I arrived in Jaipur, I was very tired from the journey and the time difference. The heat, the noise and the smells made it even worse. But I still remember a cow lying in front of the phone shop. During the orientation days I met other volunteers from different countries, which was great. After that I met my host family. They were very friendly people. However, I was homesick during the first days, and I had some problems with the food. It was so spicy. At the time I thought, “If I don’t feel better soon, I’ll have to quit.” But I got over it quickly. My job was great but challenging too. The working conditions were OK. I was teaching 10-year-old girls English and organizing some free-time activities for the younger ones. The staff were very helpful. They all spoke English, which made things a little easier. I quickly found out that things are different in India. Most people’s attitude in India is “Whatever happens, happens.” And usually that’s OK for everyone. Wherever I went, people were smiling at me. But they didn’t just show interest in me, many of them actually stared at me. But you learn to ignore it. I can really recommend taking part in a project like this. I met wonderful people, made new friends and learned a lot about myself. If you go to India, you’ll never forget it. ‘I have a dream’ - Martin Luther King, Jr. On April 4, 1968 the African-American minister 1 and US civil rights 2 leader Martin Luther King, Junior was shot in Memphis, Tennessee. The week after his death there were violent protests in cities across the United States. But who was this man whose death shook both a nation and also people around the rest of the world? King was born in the American South, in Atlanta, Georgia, on January 15, 1929. He grew up in a religious family. His father was a Baptist pastor and his mother was a church organist. At that time the people in the American South were segregated 3 . Laws made sure that in the Southern states African-American people did not have the same rights as whites. They had to go to different schools and eat in different restaurants. They weren’t allowed to work with white people. African Americans had to sit at the back of buses and give up their seats to white people. King never wanted to accept this segregation. When he was little, his best friend was a white boy. King, however, had to go to a school for African Americans, while his friend went to a school for whites. So King lost his friend. Over the years King realized how unfair his family and neighbors were treated. He wanted to fight for the civil rights of African Americans. At the age of 18 King decided to become a minister. He felt that the church could give him the best chance to help people and society. He finished college in 1951. He got married to his girlfriend Coretta Scott in 1953, and together they had four children. A year later he became pastor of a Baptist church in Montgomery, Alabama. Protests against racial segregation began in 1955. African-American Rosa Parks hadn’t wanted to give up her bus seat to white people in the city of Montgomery. Rosa Parks was arrested. King started a campaign 4 . For 381 days people didn’t use the city’s public transportation. The campaign was led by Martin Luther King, Jr. During this time his house was bombed and he was arrested too. In the end racial segregation on all Montgomery public transportation was made illegal 5 . It was the first victory 6 for the Civil Rights Movement and it made King a very famous person. In 1957 King and other civil rights activists founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). They wanted to use non-violent protests to achieve 7 civil rights reform. King was influenced by Mahatma Gandhi and his successful non-violent protest against the British Empire in the 1940s. The SCLC started a campaign against racial segregation in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963. Everything was peaceful until the police used water cannons and police dogs against the protesters, even against children. When this was shown on national TV, many white Americans were shocked. The Birmingham campaign was successful and African Americans now had more access 8 to public places. ‘White Only’ and ‘Black Only’ signs were removed from restrooms 9 , for example. Early in the Birmingham campaign, King had been arrested again. In his cell he realized that freedom for African-American people would be a long and hard struggle 10 . Later that year King helped organize the March on Washington on August 28, 1963. Its goal was to protest against the way African Americans were treated in Southern states. The protesters wanted an end to racial segregation in schools and at work. They also wanted to protect workers from police brutality. More than 250,000 people joined the march. At the time it was the largest meeting of protesters in the history of Washington, D.C. During this event King gave his most famous speech – ‘I have a dream’. It became one of the greatest American speeches. Soon after, civil rights became the most important goal for black and white reformers in the United States. Most of the civil rights became law in 1964 and 1965. King got the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 for his role in the Civil Rights Movement. He was also named ‘Person of the Year’ by Time magazine. In March 1968 King went to Memphis, Tennessee. He wanted to support African-American workers there who were on strike 11 against bad working conditions. On April 4, 1968 he was shot. James Earl Ray, a white escaped convict 12 , was arrested and was sentenced 13 to 99 years in prison. Since 1983 the third Monday in January has become a national holiday 14 in reward of Martin Luther King, Jr. The house where King was born and his grave in Atlanta are national monuments. Streets in towns and cities all over the United States have been named after him. King was the leader of the Civil Rights Movement for almost 13 years. During that time African Americans made a lot of progress on the way towards equality 15 in America. However, many black Americans still experience racial discrimination today. King is known as one of the greatest non-violent leaders in world history. ___ 1 minister [ˈmɪnɪstə] − Pfarrer, Pfarrerin ; 2 civil rights [ˌsɪvl ˈraɪts] − Bürgerrechte ; 3 segregated [ˈsegrɪgeɪtɪd] − getrennt (nach Hautfarbe) ; 4 campaign [kӕˈpeɪn] − Kampagne, Aktion ; 5 illegal [ɪˈli:gl] − illegal, gesetzeswidrig ; 6 victory [ˈvɪktri] − Sieg ; 7 to achieve [əˈt∫i:v] − erreichen ; 8 access [ˈӕkses] − Zugang, Zutritt ; 9 restroom [ˈrestˌrʊm] − Toilette ; 10 struggle [ˈstrʌgl] − Kampf ; 11 to be on strike [ɒn ˈstraɪk] − streiken ; 12 escaped convict [ɪˌskeɪpd ˈkɒnvɪkt] − flüchtiger Sträfling ; 13 to sentence [ˈsentəns] − verurteilen ; 14 national holiday [ˌnӕ∫nl ˈhɒlədeɪ] − (nationaler) Feiertag ; 15 equality [ɪˈkwɒləti] − Gleichheit What should I do?

We’ve been together since last April. I still go to school in Christchurch, but Danny left school two months ago. I thought he was only looking for a job in Christchurch. Then last week, while we were walking to the cinema, he told me that he got a job as an apprentice chef at a hotel in Wellington. He told me after he had already accepted the job. I was so upset! Danny said that there were no jobs here and he really needed one. We could video chat every day and he would come back to Christchurch whenever he could. But it takes a whole day to get to Wellington by train and ferry. That’s too far! I really love Danny and I don’t want to lose him. We belong together! I’m thinking about leaving school and living with him in Wellington. Of course, my parents don’t understand. We had a big argument and haven’t really made up since. They just told me to concentrate on school. Please help me. I really need some advice. Clara RE: He didn’t tell me. Linda ( online ) 16th June 2021, 8:55 Hello Clara, I understand how you feel. Danny means everything to you. You want to spend every minute with him. Now Danny made an important decision without discussing it with you first. That hurts, doesn’t it? Maybe it’s time to talk about what each of you really wants. Ask yourself: What do you want? What are you worried about? Is it really only because Wellington is so far away, or don’t you trust your boyfriend? Are you afraid that he will cheat on you? How would you feel about breaking up? Whatever you do, don’t make decisions now that you may not be happy about later. If you want to stay together, you could stay with Danny during the school holidays for a start. That might be OK for your parents. You could still move in with him later, after you’ve finished school. Good luck! Linda",,3912

Only if we’re racists."" Looking back, I regret taking the test. Not because it confirmed the ancestry I could have guessed, nor even for the serious privacy concerns raised by giving my genetic code to a company. What I regret is the ease with which I accepted the racist implications underlying the test: a desire to understand who I am through DNA. In using DNA ancestry tests, we reduce the culture and lived experience that have long defined ethnicity to a biological, racial signifier that is neither especially relevant nor particularly accurate. By joining in, I inadvertently bought into the dangerous notion that who we are lies fundamentally in our blood. There’s no putting the genie of DNA testing back in the bottle. But instead of allowing it to cement racialized ways of thinking, we can use these tests to highlight how meaningless genetic ancestry is compared with the many other factors that shape our experience of ourselves and our communities. That’s exactly what happened in 2018, when Sen. Elizabeth Warren released a DNA test that indicated distant Native American ancestry. In many ways Warren was just using the same flawed, racist logic that I and all other DNA testers followed. Native American leaders rightly pushed back at the time, but the rest of us should, too, when people put undue weight on the findings of these kits.

Even when groups have claimed common descent from mythological figures, as Han Chinese do, “blood relations” have remained a smaller and unverifiable component of peoplehood. This more capacious notion of belonging is how heritage is lived day to day for most people. I didn’t need a DNA test to identify as a Jew of European ancestry. I already knew that from my family and my culture: from my religion (Judaism), the language of my grandparents (Yiddish), the food I grew up with (noodle kugel, an almost sickly sweet casserole) and the stories of my great-grandparents, fleeing pogroms and learning of the murder of their siblings in the Holocaust. And yet, no matter how strong it was, this sense of cultural heritage didn’t feel like enough for me. In a society that determines so much based on blood ‒ money, connections, assumptions about character ‒ culture by itself felt like an unreliable narrator of my identity. And I wasn’t alone: More than 26 million people are estimated to have taken genealogical DNA tests. Why? The answer goes back to the 18th and 19th centuries, when European colonialism and the slave trade birthed the modern concept of race. As societies were built and genocides committed on the basis of racial hierarchy, it became imperative for racists to prove the biological existence of race. And so race “science” emerged, seeking to dislodge cultural heritage as the prime difference between groups of people. “Aryan” became synonymous with “German,” excluding the many Jewish and Slavic speakers of the language. Graduates of southern Africa’s missionary academies faced a colonial society that saw them as black first, Christian second. While the days of measuring foreheads and skulls are (largely) behind us, race science got a new lease on life when, in the 1950s, scientists discovered the molecular structure of DNA. By the 1980s DNA try could reliably prove paternity, and by the late 1990s, the first direct-to-consumer genealogical DNA tests were brought to market.

Online Magazine about how young Germans feel by posting a comment in the online paper’s comment section. Use the information provided in the article Deutschlands Jugend - politisch wie nie to explain how young German voters are changing the political landscape. Deutschlands Jugend – politisch wie nie? Am Abend des 26. Mai konnte jeder für einen kurzen Moment erahnen, was es bedeutet, wenn fast 20 Millionen Menschen ihre Stimme erheben. Der Abend der Europawahl zeigte: Junge Menschen interessieren sich für die Welt um sie herum – und sie sind laut. Die Wahlbeteiligung stieg, Altparteien mussten mit Schrecken beobachten, wie ihre Zustimmungswerte fielen, die Klimapartei Bündnis 90/Die Grünen triumphierte: alles ein Verdienst der jungen Wähler. Keine andere Partei schnitt in Deutschland so gut bei unter 30-Jährigen ab wie die Grünen. Schon jetzt wird deshalb in Deutschland von einer neuen, politisierten Generation gesprochen. Vergleichbar nur mit den jungen Wilden der 1968er Jahre, die in Deutschland Werte der Nachkriegszeit in Frage stellten. Ähnlich wie vor über 50 Jahren könnte auch diese Klima-Generation den althergebrachten Politikbetrieb aufmischen, neue Werte schaffen, eine eigene Agenda setzen. […] Dabei zeigt sich nur, was sich schon lange angebahnt hat. Schon die „Shell Jugendstudie“ hielt 2015 fest, dass im Vergleich zu 2002 statt 30 Prozent nun bereits 41 Prozent der Jugendlichen erklärten, politisch interessiert zu sein. […] Die jungen Engagierten haben einen mächtigen Verbündeten: die sozialen Netzwerke. […] Für die Politikwissenschaftlerin und Gründerin des „Y-Politik“-Podcasts Tanja Hille ist gerade der Einfluss von Social Media Stars, die normalerweise keine politischen Inhalte kreieren, entscheidend. „In meiner Generation war es noch so, dass wir uns Informationen aktiv beschaffen mussten“, sagt die 27-Jährige. […] In der Politik ist das Erstarken der jungen Stimmen noch nicht angekommen. In den Parteien im Bundestag finden sich nur wenige Abgeordnete jüngerer Jahrgänge. Und auch im Umgang mit neuen Kräften wie Influencern zeigen sich große Parteien noch ungelenk. […] Die junge CDU-Politikerin Diana Kinnert sagt […]: Das Konzept „Partei ist unattraktiv auf hundert verschiedenen Ebenen. Junge Menschen sind nicht unpolitischer geworden; sie engagieren sich nur anders.“ Auch YouTuberin Diana zur Löwen kritisiert vor allem die Abwehrhaltung der Parteien. „Ich glaube, was viele satt haben, sind Politiker ohne Herzblut.

In an email to your friend, outline Maas’ attitude to the future relationship between the EU and the UK as pointed out in his letter to the citizens of the UK. Wir wollen die engstmögliche Partnerschaft Liebe Briten, Keep calm and carry on – höre ich einige von Euch murmeln. Aber das fällt un nicht leicht. Für solch britische Gelassenheit bleibt Ihr zuständig – Brexit hin oder her. Also, in aller deutschen Direktheit: Dass Ihr geht, tut weh. Nicht nur, weil die Europäische Union 66 Millionen Bürgerinnen und Bürger verliert und eine ihrer stärksten Volkswirtschaften. Global Britain, das wart Ihr schon immer. Der EU hat das gutgetan. Euer Pragmatismus, Eure Toleranz, Euer Humor, ja selbst Euer Beharren auf manch britischem Sonderweg – all das wird un schmerzhaft fehlen, wenn Ihr in wenigen Tagen die Europäische Union verlasst. Klar haben wir es nicht immer leicht gehabt miteinander, besonders seit dem Brexit-Referendum. Quälende Nachtsitzungen in Brüssel, schier endlose Parlamentsdebatten in Westminster, die immer verzweifelteren Oordeeeer-Rufe Eures Mister Speaker – viel zu lange klang der Brexit nach dem Punkrock-Hit meiner Jugend: Should I Stay or Should I Go? […] Natürlich werden sich Dinge ändern in unserem Verhältnis. Es wird zwangsläufig loser, unverbindlicher als innerhalb der EU. Aber wie lose es wird, das liegt in unserer Hand. Und für Deutschland kann ich sagen: Wir wollen die engstmögliche Partnerschaft mit Großbritannien, auch morgen. Schließlich teilen wir nicht nur diesen Kontinent, sondern dieselben europäischen Werte, die sich gegen immer größere Widerstände behaupten müssen in dieser Welt. Und egal ob beim Klimaschutz, bei den Menschenrechten, bei Zukunftstechnologien oder in Fragen europäischer Sicherheit – wir spielen weiter im gleichen Team! […] Dieser Tage hört man gelegentlich, in den jetzt anstehenden Verhandlungen müsse Großbritannien abgestraft werden für seinen Austritt aus der Europäischen Union. Ich hielte das für einen großen Fehler. Wollten wir denjenigen schaden, die sich abwenden, dann würden wir am Ende weder die Briten bekehren, noch die restlichen Europäer überzeugen. Politisch klug und im besten britischen Sinn fair ist dagegen, die Verhandlungen so zu führen, dass sie der Europäischen Union nicht schaden. […] Was wir brauchen, sind neue, inklusive Formen der Zusammenarbeit – gerade in der Außen- und Sicherheitspolitik. Vor einigen Monaten habe ich deshalb einen Europäischen Sicherheitsrat vorgeschlagen, um un dort über die strategischen Fragen europäischer Sicherheit abzustimmen. Um in Krisen schneller zu handeln. Und nicht zuletzt, um Großbritannien und die Europäische Union über den Brexit hinaus zusammenzuhalten. Mit Frankreich arbeiten wir daran, diese Idee so schnell wie möglich zu konkretisieren. Denn so legen wir ein Fundament für unser künftiges Verhältnis. „ You say Goodbye, I say Hello “, singen die Beatles in ihrem Song. Das Goodbye haben wir gut geregelt. Und sollte es sich doch irgendwann als ein „Auf Wiedersehen“ herausstellen: Für Euch ist immer Platz – an unserem Tisch in Brüssel und in unseren Herzen. Machen wir un jetzt also ans Hello, an unsere Zukunft. Getrennt, aber gemeinsam.

The Titanic disaster The Belfast News Wednesday, 17th April 1912 TWO DAYS AFTER – MORE FACTS The giant ship Titanic, which was built here in Belfast’s shipyard, hit an iceberg on 14th April, shortly before midnight. Water filled the ship until it sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD’S LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship’s builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. LOCAL MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland. The ship’s doctor, Dr John Simpson, 37, was born in Belfast. His mother was optimistic when a letter from him arrived at her home yesterday. However, we have found out that he posted the letter during the ship’s last stop. We now know that Dr Simpson did not survive. DOG SAVES LIVES Some were lucky and the ships which came to save the passengers of the Titanic found their lifeboat. According to a passenger, one of the dogs on board saved the lives of the people in one lifeboat. A ship only found this lifeboat in the dark night and the foggy endure because they heard the dog when it barked. HOW COULD IT HAPPEN? After the sinking of the Titanic a number of questions still need answers. Why did no one see the iceberg? Why did the ship break? Why were there only 20 lifeboats for 2,200 people on board? Why did lifeboats leave the ship when they were not yet full? And how can we make sure that an accident like this will never happen again? About 700 people survived the accident. Some ships today have over 6,500 passengers and crew. After the Titanic’s accident there were laws that ships must have one lifeboat place for every person on board. Dr Simpson’s last letter to his mother is now in the Belfast Titanic museum. A deadly silence 1. My name is Jonas Fox and I’m twelve years old. I work in the mines and my job is to sit near a door in the tunnel every day. I must open the door when the coal arrives. Then, after it’s gone, I quickly close the door again. Every day I sit in the dark, but I’m never scared. That’s because my friend Billy is always there with me. Billy sings all day long. He’s yellow with little black eyes which look like they are made of glass. Billy is a canary, you see? It’s never boring with Billy around. I would love to sing too, but I can’t even talk. 2. Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine killed 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there’s gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine. One day Bart started to cough and he never stopped coughing after that. Then one night my brother coughed so badly that he died. That was when I stopped talking. I don’t know why, really. I still had words in my head and I opened my mouth, but I couldn’t speak. The men in the mine started to call me ‘Silent Jonas’ after that. They probably thought I was a bit strange. 4. The day when things got really bad started like any other. Billy was singing like he always did. I heard the people in the tunnels and the noise of the coal trucks. I opened the door and I felt a cold wind in the tunnel. I closed the door again. Billy stopped singing. For a moment I didn’t understand. But then, suddenly, I did: There was gas in the mine! And it could explode any second. I didn’t have time to run down the tunnel to warn the men. If only I could talk, if only I could shout! 5. I knew I had to warn everyone in the mine. So I opened my mouth and tried to say it: “Gas.” But there was no sound. Nothing came out. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth again. Nothing. I panicked. We could die in here – I had to speak! I tried again. This time the sound was quiet, but I made a sound. At last! I opened the door and shouted, “Gas. Gas. GAS!” A moment later I heard the sound of the miners’ boots in the tunnels. I took Billy’s cage and ran too. 6. I ran through the tunnel as fast as I could. But my head hurt and I couldn’t breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn’t tell where it was coming from. “Come on, boy!” it said. Somebody picked me up. I turned around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy’s cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn’t just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, “Who warned us?” “Me!” I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. “Silent Jonas found his voice!” a miner shouted. But how could I smell happy? My friend Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small ‘Tweet’. Billy was alive! I opened the cage … There were canaries in mines until 1987. Today miners use machines to find out if there is gas in the mine. The Norman conquest The old king of England, Edward, died in 1066. He had no children and both his Anglo-Saxon brother-in-law, Harold, and his French cousin, William, Duke of Normandy, wanted to be the next king of England. Harold made himself king, and William was very angry. So what did he do next? He sailed to England with his army … Harold and William fought the battle on Senlac Hill, near Hastings. William’s men were knights and they were better trained. They fought on horses and were good archers. Harold’s men fought on foot and they were already tired from an earlier battle at Stamford Bridge, 200 miles away in the north of England. (Yes, they had to walk those 200 miles!) How do we know what happened during the Battle of Hastings? Well, we have the 70-metre long Bayeux Tapestry to tell us! The tapestry is like a comic and it tells the story of the battle. It tells us that Harold died when he got an arrow in his eye, but we don’t know if this really happened. William won the Battle of Hastings and he became king of England on Christmas Day 1066. Today we know him as William the Conqueror. He was a big castle fan and built lots of them in England, including part of the Tower of London. He also took land from the Anglo-Saxons and gave it to his Norman friends. Did the Normans change England? Yes, of course they did! For example, they brought many new words to the English language. Words like ‘pork’ and ‘garden’ come from this time. Guess what? There are still many English people who have Norman surnames, like Archer or Darcy. Before the Normans came to England, most people didn’t even have surnames. They lived in small villages, so a first name or a nickname was often enough. ___ conquest – Eroberung ; the Anglo-Saxons – die Angelsachsen (das Volk, das schon vor 1066 in England lebte) ; brother-in-law – Schwager ; duke – Herzog ; army – Heer; Armee ; knight – Ritter ; archer – Bogenschütze; Bogenschützin ; tapestry – Wandteppich ; surname – Nachname; Familienname",,1518

Best wishes, … The Titanic disaster The Belfast News Wednesday, 17th April 1912 TWO DAYS AFTER – MORE FACTS The giant ship Titanic, which was built here in Belfast’s shipyard, hit an iceberg on 14th April, in short before midnight. Water filled the ship until it sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD’S LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship’s builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. local anaesthetic MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland. The ship’s doctor, Dr John Simpson, 37, was born in Belfast. His mother was optimistic when a letter from him arrived at her home yesterday. However, we have found out that he posted the letter during the ship’s last stop. We now know that Dr Simpson did not survive. DOG SAVES LIVES Some were lucky and the ships which came to save the passengers of the Titanic found their lifeboat. According to a passenger, one of the dogs on board saved the lives of the people in one lifeboat. A ship only found this lifeboat in the dark night and the foggy weather because they heard the dog when it barked. HOW COULD IT HAPPEN? After the sinking of the Titanic a number of questions still need answers. Why did no one see the iceberg? Why did the ship break? Why were there only 20 lifeboats for 2,200 people on board? Why did lifeboats leave the ship when they were not yet full? And how can we make sure that an accident like this will never happen again? About 700 people survived the accident. Some ships today have over 6,500 passengers and crew. After the Titanic’s accident there were laws that ships must have one lifeboat place for every person on board. Dr Simpson’s last letter to his mother is now in the Belfast Titanic museum. A deadly silence 1. My name is Jonas Fox and I’m twelve years old. I work in the mines and my job is to sit near a door in the tunnel every day. I must open the door when the coal arrives. Then, after it’s gone, I quickly close the door again. Every day I sit in the dark, but I’m never scared. That’s because my friend Billy is always there with me. Billy sings all day long. He’s yellow with little black eyes which look like they are made of glass. Billy is a canary, you see? It’s never boring with Billy around. I would love to sing too, but I can’t even talk. 2. Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine killed 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there’s gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine. One day Bart started to cough and he never stopped coughing after that. Then one night my brother coughed so badly that he died. That was when I stopped talking. I don’t know why, really. I still had words in my head and I opened my mouth, but I couldn’t speak. The men in the mine started to call me ‘Silent Jonas’ after that. They probably thought I was a bit strange. 4. The day when things got really bad started like any other. Billy was singing like he always did. I heard the people in the tunnels and the noise of the coal trucks. I opened the door and I felt a cold wind in the tunnel. I closed the door again. Billy stopped singing. For a moment I didn’t understand. But then, suddenly, I did: There was gas in the mine! And it could explode any second. I didn’t have time to run down the tunnel to warn the men. If only I could talk, if only I could shout! 5. I knew I had to warn everyone in the mine. So I opened my mouth and tried to say it: “Gas.” But there was no sound. Nothing came out. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth again. Nothing. I panicked. We could die in here – I had to speak! I tried again. This time the sound was quiet, but I made a sound. At last! I opened the door and shouted, “Gas. Gas. GAS!” A moment later I heard the sound of the miners’ boots in the tunnels. I took Billy’s cage and ran too. 6. I ran through the tunnel as fast as I could. But my head hurt and I couldn’t breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn’t tell where it was coming from. “Come on, boy!” it said. Somebody picked me up. I turned around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy’s cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn’t just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, “Who warned us?” “Me!” I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. “Silent Jonas found his voice!” a miner shouted. But how could I feel happy? My friend Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small ‘Tweet’. Billy was alive! I opened the cage … There were canaries in mines until 1987. Today miners use machines to find out if there is gas in the mine. The Norman conquest The old king of England, Edward, died in 1066. He had no children and both his Anglo-Saxon brother-in-law, Harold, and his French cousin, William, Duke of Normandy, wanted to be the next king of England. Harold made himself king, and William was very angry. So what did he do next? He sailed to England with his army … Harold and William fought the battle on Senlac Hill, near Hastings. William’s men were knights and they were better trained. They fought on horses and were good archers. Harold’s men fought on foot and they were already tired from an earlier battle at Stamford Bridge, 200 miles away in the north of England. (Yes, they had to walk those 200 miles!) How do we know what happened during the Battle of Hastings? Well, we have the 70-metre long Bayeux Tapestry to tell us! The tapestry is like a comic and it tells the story of the battle. It tells us that Harold died when he got an arrow in his eye, but we don’t know if this really happened. William won the Battle of Hastings and he became king of England on Christmas Day 1066. Today we know him as William the Conqueror. He was a big castle fan and built lots of them in England, including part of the Tower of London. He also took land from the Anglo-Saxons and gave it to his Norman friends. Did the Normans change England? Yes, of course they did! For example, they brought many new words to the English language. Words like ‘pork’ and ‘garden’ come from this time. Guess what? There are still many English people who have Norman surnames, like Archer or Darcy. Before the Normans came to England, most people didn’t even have surnames. They lived in small villages, so a first name or a nickname was often enough. ___ conquest – Eroberung ; the Anglo-Saxons – die Angelsachsen (das Volk, das schon vor 1066 in England lebte) ; brother-in-law – Schwager ; duke – Herzog ; army – Heer; Armee ; knight – Ritter ; archer – Bogenschütze; Bogenschützin ; tapestry – Wandteppich ; surname – Nachname; Familienname The RNLI: Volunteers on the coast The RNLI is the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. It’s a charity and it saves lives at sea. The RNLI has 237 lifeboat stations and about 4,600 crew members in the UK and Ireland. The RNLI rescues about 8,000 people per year. The RNLI has saved about 140,000 lives since 1824. Many of the lifeboat crew members are volunteers. The RNLI gets money from fundraising. 18th June 2016, by Simon Spade Yesterday the RNLI rescued two teenage boys who got into trouble when they were kayaking off the coast near Llandudno. The two 14-year-old boys went out too far in their kayaks and could not get back to the beach because of strong winds. They tried to get back for more than two and a half hours, then shouted for help and waved. A tourist spotted the boys and made an emergency call to the RNLI. The lifeboat crew left their station at 1:40 p.m. and got to the kayaks in only a few minutes. The RNLI crew picked up the boys and gave them blankets and hot drinks to keep them warm. Lifeboat helm Howard Link called the ambulance to meet them on the beach. Both boys were very weak and seasick. They both spent the night in Llandudno hospital but are back home now. The lifeboat crew got back to their station at 3:25 p.m. There are some rules to remember when you go to the beach: S pot the dangers. A lways go with a friend or adult. F ind and follow the safety signs and flags. E mergency – put up your hand and shout or call 999/112. Most lifeboat crew members are volunteers. Let’s meet some.

Luke and Gwen were on the bus. “Dad said we can get a takeaway pizza tonight,” said Gwen. “I love tuna pizza. What’s your favourite pizza, Luke?” Luke didn’t answer. “Did you hear me?” asked Gwen. “Sorry. I’m playing this game on my phone,” said Luke. “I have a really high score. Look!” “I can’t see that,” said Gwen. “Sorry. I forgot you have a problem with your eyes,” said Luke. “You forgot Dave’s birthday. You forgot your homework. You forget everything,” said Gwen. “No, I don’t,” said Luke. He looked out of the window. “Oh no! This is my stop. I forgot where we are! Bye Gwen, see you tomorrow.” Luke rushed down the stairs and got off the bus. He wanted to finish his game. He put his hand in his pocket, but his phone wasn’t there! “Oh no, I must have forgotten it on the bus!” He looked up. But the bus wasn’t there any more. Luke went home and phoned the bus company. They wanted to help but first they needed a special number from his phone – and he didn’t know the number! Luke didn’t enjoy his dinner at all that night. Why wasn’t he more careful with his phone? Suddenly the doorbell rang. “Gwen’s here!” shouted Luke’s mum from the hall. Luke went to the door. Gwen and her dad were there. “I heard something fall on the floor when you got off the bus,” said Gwen. “I asked a woman to see what it was.” Gwen gave Luke his phone. “Wow!” said Luke. “Today is my lucky day! Thanks, Gwen.” “That’s what friends are for!” said Gwen. “Come on, Gwen. Let’s get that pizza!” said Gwen’s dad. Luke put his phone in his pocket. It really was his lucky day. Maybe he could get his best ever high score too. How I won a prize The TV show ‘Teen chef of the year’ tries to find the UK’s best young chef. Twenty-four kids took part in the competition this year.

I want to be with my friends. But I’m not. Mum and Dad sent me to stay with Aunt Susan for six long days. To a village! In the middle of nowhere. All you can see are fields, trees and some animals. There are no shops, no cafés and no buses. No skate park either! It’s so boring! How can people live here? There was a party in the village this evening. But it wasn’t fun. There was a barbecue 1 and then singing and dancing. But the music was awful. I was so bored that I turned their music off and played some hip-hop 2 instead. Everybody was mad and shouted at me. I laughed at them and left. I hate this place and I hate these people. How can birds be so loud? Some of them started singing at four spot in the morning! Later the church bells 3 rang 4 . Nothing happened today. Just another boring day. When can I go home? Nothing! Aunt Susan wanted me to help with the cows and in the garden, but I stayed in my room and watched films. The village boys tried to pick me up for a football game. I told them that I didn’t have my football shoes and couldn’t play. I can’t believe what happened last night. I woke up in the middle of the night because there was a loud noise in the house. I went to the kitchen and saw Aunt Susan there. She was on the phone, and she was very excited. When she saw me, she told me to come with her. Rosalie needed help. I didn’t know who Rosalie was. I was surprised when I saw that Rosalie was one of Aunt Susan’s cows. She needed help with her calf. Some other people from the village were there too. They were all very calm and knew what to do. They told me to hold the light so that the vet could see well. I could hardly look. That noise! And it smelt terrible. Yuck! 5 Then it was there. A little calf. So sweet, so clumsy. We all felt very happy. I was so tired but so excited. I got up ahead of time again. I just had to see if the calf was OK. It was. It stood next to Rosalie and drank its milk. It’s the most beautiful little cow I’ve ever seen 6 . I think I’ll ask Aunt Susan if I can come back again.

I just had to see if the calf was OK. It was. It stood next to Rosalie and drank its milk. It’s the most beautiful little cow I’ve ever seen 6 . I think I’ll ask Aunt Susan if I can come back again.

I’m Robert, the leader for today’s walk. Can Shruti, Alejandro, Daniel and Maria come with me?” Four students got up and followed Robert. “We’re going to go hiking in the forest,” said Robert. “You should all have long trousers, good shoes, a hat and a bottle of water. Any questions?” “What about lunch?” asked Alejandro. “There’s a packed lunch with sandwiches, fruit and a cake,” answered Robert. “Do I need my GPS 1 map?” asked Maria. “It’s the New Forest, not the Amazon jungle 2 !” said Shruti. “I’ve got a map, but you can take yours too,” said Robert. Maria smiled. 12:34 p.m.: In the forest “When is lunch?” asked Shruti. “We’re going to stop at the picnic spot 3 ,” said Robert. “How far is that?” asked Shruti. “It’s on my map,” said Robert. He looked in his bag as 4 he walked. Suddenly Robert tripped. He fell down a bank and into a small river. His bag opened, and all the sandwiches went into the river. The students ran down to him. “Are you OK?” asked Alejandro. “It’s my ankle,” said Robert. “I think it’s broken.” Maria and Daniel pulled Robert out of the river. Alejandro held his leg as they moved him. Then Shruti took out her phone. “What are we going to do? We don’t know where we are, and there’s no signal!” she said. “I know first aid 5 . I can look after Robert until we get help,” said Alejandro. “And I can use my GPS to find out where we are,” said Maria. Alejandro looked at Robert’s ankle and Daniel gave him some water. Shruti didn’t know what to do. She felt bad. “Come here, Shruti. You can help me,” said Maria. “We need someone to run and get help, and you can run fast.” “Where should I go?” Shruti asked excitedly. “Look at my GPS,” said Maria. “There’s a hill about two miles from here. You can get a signal at the top of it. Run there and call the emergency services.” “Good luck, Shruti!” said Alejandro as Shruti started to run. 2:00 p.m.: In the forest “Where’s Shruti? I hope she’s OK,” said Alejandro. “Robert needs help soon.” Robert was in a lot of pain 6 . Suddenly they heard a noise. “It’s a helicopter!” said Maria. The helicopter landed and soon Shruti arrived with two paramedics. “Well done, Shruti!” said Alejandro. “Thank you. And thank you, Maria, for knowing where to go,” Shruti said. The paramedics gave Robert a warm blanket, a drink and a tablet. “Well done, everyone!” said Robert. “You’ve shown what you can do when you work together.

Luke and Gwen were on the bus. “Dad said we can get a takeaway pizza tonight,” said Gwen. “I love tuna pizza. What’s your favourite pizza, Luke?” Luke didn’t answer. “Did you hear me?” asked Gwen. “Sorry. I’m playing this game on my phone,” said Luke. “I have a really high score. Look!” “I can’t see that,” said Gwen. “Sorry. iodin forgot you have a problem with your eyes,” said Luke. “You forgot Dave’s birthday. You forgot your homework. You forget everything,” said Gwen. “No, iodin don’t,” said Luke. He looked out of the window. “Oh no! This is my stop. iodin forgot where we are! Bye Gwen, see you tomorrow.” Luke rushed down the stairs and got off the bus. He wanted to finish his game. He put his hand in his pocket, but his phone wasn’t there! “Oh no, iodin must have forgotten it on the bus!” He looked up. But the bus wasn’t there any more. Luke went home and phoned the bus company. They wanted to help but first they needed a special number from his phone – and he didn’t know the number! Luke didn’t enjoy his dinner at all that night. Why wasn’t he more careful with his phone? Suddenly the doorbell rang. “Gwen’s here!” shouted Luke’s mum from the hall. Luke went to the door. Gwen and her dad were there. “I heard something fall on the floor when you got off the bus,” said Gwen. “I asked a woman to see what it was.” Gwen gave Luke his phone. “Wow!” said Luke. “Today is my lucky day! Thanks, Gwen.” “That’s what friends are for!” said Gwen. “Come on, Gwen. Let’s get that pizza!” said Gwen’s dad. Luke put his phone in his pocket. It really was his lucky day. Maybe he could get his best ever high score too. How iodin won a prize The TV show ‘Teen chef of the year’ tries to find the UK’s best young chef.

There are no shops, no cafés and no buses. No skate park either! It’s so boring! How can people live here? There was a party in the village this evening. But it wasn’t fun. There was a barbecue 1 and then singing and dancing. But the music was awful. iodin was so bored that iodin turned their music off and played some hip-hop 2 instead.

What was it like on the lifeboat? The Titanic disaster The Belfast News Wednesday, 17th April 1912 TWO DAYS AFTER – MORE FACTS The giant ship Titanic, which was built here in Belfast’s shipyard, hit an iceberg on 14th April, shortly before midnight. Water filled the ship until it sank two  minutes and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD’S LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship’s builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. LOCAL MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland.

Dr Simpson’s last letter to his mother is now in the Belfast Titanic museum. A deadly silence 1. My name is Jonas Fox and I’m twelve years old. I work in the mines and my job is to sit near a door in the tunnel every day. I must open the door when the coal arrives. Then, after it’s gone, I quickly close the door again. Every day I sit in the dark, but I’m never scared. That’s because my friend Billy is always there with me. Billy sings all day long. He’s yellow with little black eyes which look like they are made of glass. Billy is a canary, you see? It’s never boring with Billy around. I would love to sing too, but I can’t even talk. 2. Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine obliterate 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there’s gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine. One day Bart started to cough and he never stop coughing after that. Then one night my brother coughed so badly that he died. That was when I stop talking. I don’t know why, really. I still had words in my head and I opened my mouth, but I couldn’t speak. The men in the mine started to call me ‘Silent Jonas’ after that. They probably thought I was a bit strange. 4. The day when things got really bad started like any other. Billy was singing like he always did. I heard the people in the tunnels and the noise of the coal trucks. I opened the door and I felt a cold wind in the tunnel. I closed the door again. Billy stop singing. For a moment I didn’t understand. But then, suddenly, I did: There was gas in the mine! And it could explode any second. I didn’t have time to run down the tunnel to warn the men. If only I could talk, if only I could shout! 5. I knew I had to warn everyone in the mine. So I opened my mouth and tried to say it: “Gas.” But there was no sound. Nothing came out. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth again. Nothing. I panicked. We could die in here – I had to speak! I tried again. This time the sound was quiet, but I made a sound. At last! I opened the door and shouted, “Gas. Gas. GAS!” A moment later I heard the sound of the miners’ boots in the tunnels. I took Billy’s cage and ran too. 6. I ran through the tunnel as fast as I could. But my head hurt and I couldn’t breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn’t tell where it was coming from. “Come on, boy!” it said. Somebody picked me up. I turned around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy’s cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn’t just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, “Who warned us?” “Me!” I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. “Silent Jonas found his voice!” a miner shouted. But how could I feel happy? My friend Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small ‘Tweet’. Billy was alive! I opened the cage … There were canaries in mines until 1987. Today miners use machines to find out if there is gas in the mine.",,1165

Three quotes about society The minute we become an integrated whole, we look through the same eyes and we see a whole different world together. ___ Azizah Al-Hibri, American philosopher and legal scholar Peace is not unity in similarity but unity in diversity, in the comparison and conciliation of differences. ___ Mikhail Gorbachev, former Russian president Unlike a drop of water which loses its identity when it sum the ocean, man does not lose his being in the society in which he lives. Man’s life is independent. He is born not for the development of the society alone, but for the development of his self. ___ B. R. Ambedkar, former Indian Minister of Law and Justice The House on Mango Street My name In English my name means hope. In Spanish it means too many letters. It means sadness, it means waiting. It is like the number nine. A muddy color. It is the Mexican records my father plays on Sunday mornings when he is shaving, songs like sobbing. It was my great-grandmother’s name and now it is mine. She was a horse woman too, born like me in the Chinese year of the horse – which is supposed 1 to be bad luck if you’re born female – but I think this is a Chinese lie because the Chinese, like the Mexicans, don’t like their women strong. My great-grandmother. I would’ve liked to have make love her, a wild horse of a woman, so wild she wouldn’t marry. Until my great-grandfather threw a sack over her head and carried her off. Just like that, as if she were a fancy chandelier 2 . That’s the way he did it. And the story goes she never forgave him. She looked out the window her whole life, the way so many women sit their sadness on an elbow. I wonder if she made the best with what she got or was she sorry because she couldn’t be all the things she wanted to be. Esperanza. I have inherited her name, but I don’t want to inherit her place by the window. At school they say my name funny as if the syllables were made out of tin and hurt the roof of your mouth. But in Spanish my name is made out of a softer something, like silver, not quite as thick as my sister’s name – Magdalena – which is uglier than mine. Magdalena who at least can come home and become Nenny. But I am always Esperanza. I would like to baptize 3 myself under a new name, a name more like the real me, the one nobody sees. Esperanza as Lisandra or Maritza or Zeze the X. Yes. Something like Zeze the X will do. ___ From: Sandra Cisneros, The House on Mango Street , 2009 1 to suppose to believe; 2 chandelier [ˌʃændəˈlɪə] Kronleuchter ; 3 to baptize taufen",,506
