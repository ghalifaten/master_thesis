Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy \u2013 after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world\u2019s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren\u2019t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is \u2018fracking\u2019, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, \u201cFracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.\u201d But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada\u2019s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the end of this yet,\u201d says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. \u201cCO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.\u201d 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven\u2019t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won\u2019t change. \u201cWhat worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.\u201d Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable \u2013 which means that when we have used them up, there simply won\u2019t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada\u2019s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better \u2013 and we will have to.   The sound of ice I\u2019m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn\u2019t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship\u2019s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the \u2018northwest passage\u2019, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn\u2019t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship\u2019s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It\u2019s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn\u2019t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we\u2019d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn\u2019t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn\u2019t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back\u2019s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can\u2019t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let\u2019s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I\u2019m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown. Stephen Samuel Stanley \u2013 ship\u2019s doctor, HMS Erebus"}

The Body In \u201cThe Body\u201d, Gordie Lachance and his three friends learn that a boy from their area, in the state of Maine, has disappeared and is probably dead. They decide to go on a trip to find the boy\u2019s body and prepare for the trip. The Gun My room was on the second floor, and it was really hot up there. I was glad I wasn\u2019t sleeping there that night, and the thought of where we were going made me excited again. I rolled up two blankets and tied an old belt around them. I grabbed all my money, which was less than a dollar. Then I was ready to go. I went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad. I was walking up Carbine Street towards the clubhouse when Chris caught up with me. His eyes were shining. \u201cGordie! You want to see something?\u201d \u201cSure. What?\u201d \u201cCome down here first.\u201d He pointed down an alley between two shops. \u201cWhat is it, Chris?\u201d \u201cCome on, I said!\u201d He ran down the alley and I ran after him. At the bottom, the smell from the trash was terrible. \u201cChris, I\u2019m going to puke, I\u2019m \u2013 \u201d But I forgot about the smell when Chris put his hand into his backpack and pulled out a big gun. \u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d \u201cFrom my dad\u2019s desk.\u201d \u201cMan, your dad\u2019s going to beat you when he finds out.\u201d Chris\u2019s eyes just went on dancing. \u201cHe isn\u2019t going to find out. He and his friends have got enough wine to keep them drunk for a week. I\u2019ll put it back before then.\u201d Chris hated alcohol \u2013 he\u2019d already seen too much of what it can do. He was the only one of us who didn\u2019t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they\u2019d stolen from their father. \u201cHave you got bullets for it?\u201d \u201cNine of them \u2013 all that was left in the box. He\u2019ll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.\u201d \u201cAny in it at the moment?\u201d \u201cNo, of course not. What do you think I am?\u201d I finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA \u2013 BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin \u2013 it was the work of an evil magician. \u201cWow!\u201d I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn\u2019t tell if he was amused or scared. \u201cYou did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!\u201d \u201cShut up! Let\u2019s go!\u201d I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. \u201cMan, it\u2019s a pity you couldn\u2019t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.\u201d \u201cYou knew there was a bullet in it, didn\u2019t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad\u2019s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.\u201d Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, \u201cWhat do you think we need a gun for?\u201d \u201cNothing, really,\u201d Chris said. \u201cExcept we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it\u2019s frightening out in the forest at night.\u201d Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?\u201d Teddy asked Vern. \u201cYeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it\u2019ll look as if we\u2019re there after dark.\u201d \u201cHey, man, great!\u201d I said, and slapped Vern on the back. For him, that was real thinking. He grinned. \u201cSo let\u2019s go,\u201d Teddy said. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly twelve already.\u201d Chris stood up and we gathered round him. \u201cWe\u2019ll walk across Beeman\u2019s field,\u201d he said, \u201cand then we\u2019ll get to the railway tracks and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.\u201d \u201cHow far is it, do you think?\u201d Teddy asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Chris. \u201cHarlow\u2019s big. We\u2019re going to have to walk at least twenty miles. Does that sound right to you, Gordie?\u201d \u201cYeah. Maybe more \u2013 thirty miles.\u201d \u201cCome on, you guys,\u201d Chris said, and picked up his backpack, blankets and water bottle.   Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? headline written by Pam Warner (published 07\/12\/16 in Health & Style ) author, date, source What is your Thanksgiving like? Turkey and pumpkin pie? American football on the sofa? In the last couple of years a new trend has become popular in the USA: More people like to eat better quality food and live a more active life. introduction It is slowly going out of fashion to live off convenience and frozen food. A number of people shop for organic food at special supermarkets instead. In some states farmers\u2019 markets offer a great variety of fresh vegetables and fruit from the region. \u201cThere are also dairy products, bread and meat without chemical additives at these markets. Organic food is not only much healthier but it tastes a lot better as well,\u201d explains Emma from Boston. So how about some healthy recipes for Thanksgiving? Maybe pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes? A roast turkey breast or a turkey roulade filled with apples and cranberries is delicious too. But there\u2019s more to a healthy lifestyle than just food. A lot of trend sports show that you can have fun, spend time with friends and stay fit at the same time. Have you found the right sport for you yet? If not, here is a suggestion: How about standup paddleboarding? If you like water, that\u2019s the ideal kind of sport for you. You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: \u201cDrinking too much alcohol isn\u2019t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?\u201d Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don\u2019t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion"}

Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy \u2013 after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world\u2019s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren\u2019t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is \u2018fracking\u2019, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, \u201cFracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.\u201d But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada\u2019s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the end of this yet,\u201d says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. \u201cCO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.\u201d 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven\u2019t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won\u2019t change. \u201cWhat worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.\u201d Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable \u2013 which means that when we have used them up, there simply won\u2019t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada\u2019s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better \u2013 and we will have to.   The sound of ice I\u2019m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn\u2019t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship\u2019s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the \u2018northwest passage\u2019, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn\u2019t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship\u2019s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It\u2019s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn\u2019t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we\u2019d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn\u2019t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn\u2019t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back\u2019s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can\u2019t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let\u2019s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I\u2019m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown.

The Titanic disaster The Belfast News Wednesday, 17th April 1912 TWO DAYS AFTER \u2013 MORE FACTS The giant ship Titanic, which was built here in Belfast\u2019s shipyard, hit an iceberg on 14th April, shortly before midnight. Water filled the ship until it sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD\u2019S LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship\u2019s builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. LOCAL MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland. The ship\u2019s doctor, Dr John Simpson, 37, was born in Belfast. His mother was optimistic when a letter from him arrived at her home yesterday. However, we have found out that he posted the letter during the ship\u2019s last stop. We now know that Dr Simpson did not survive. DOG SAVES LIVES Some were lucky and the ships which came to save the passengers of the Titanic found their lifeboat. According to a passenger, one of the dogs on board saved the lives of the people in one lifeboat. A ship only found this lifeboat in the dark night and the foggy weather because they heard the dog when it barked. HOW COULD IT HAPPEN? After the sinking of the Titanic a number of questions still need answers. Why did no one see the iceberg? Why did the ship break? Why were there only 20 lifeboats for 2,200 people on board? Why did lifeboats leave the ship when they were not yet full? And how can we make sure that an accident like this will never happen again? About 700 people survived the accident. Some ships today have over 6,500 passengers and crew. After the Titanic\u2019s accident there were laws that ships must have one lifeboat place for every person on board. Dr Simpson\u2019s last letter to his mother is now in the Belfast Titanic museum.   A deadly silence 1. My name is Jonas Fox and I\u2019m twelve years old. I work in the mines and my job is to sit near a door in the tunnel every day. I must open the door when the coal arrives. Then, after it\u2019s gone, I quickly close the door again. Every day I sit in the dark, but I\u2019m never scared. That\u2019s because my friend Billy is always there with me. Billy sings all day long. He\u2019s yellow with little black eyes which look like they are made of glass. Billy is a canary, you see? It\u2019s never boring with Billy around. I would love to sing too, but I can\u2019t even talk. 2. Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine killed 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there\u2019s gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine. One day Bart started to cough and he never stopped coughing after that. Then one night my brother coughed so badly that he died. That was when I stopped talking. I don\u2019t know why, really. I still had words in my head and I opened my mouth, but I couldn\u2019t speak. The men in the mine started to call me \u2018Silent Jonas\u2019 after that. They probably thought I was a bit strange. 4. The day when things got really bad started like any other. Billy was singing like he always did. I heard the people in the tunnels and the noise of the coal trucks. I opened the door and I felt a cold wind in the tunnel. I closed the door again. Billy stopped singing. For a moment I didn\u2019t understand. But then, suddenly, I did: There was gas in the mine! And it could explode any second. I didn\u2019t have time to run down the tunnel to warn the men. If only I could talk, if only I could shout! 5. I knew I had to warn everyone in the mine. So I opened my mouth and tried to say it: \u201cGas.\u201d But there was no sound. Nothing came out. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth again. Nothing. I panicked. We could die in here \u2013 I had to speak! I tried again. This time the sound was quiet, but I made a sound. At last! I opened the door and shouted, \u201cGas. Gas. GAS!\u201d A moment later I heard the sound of the miners\u2019 boots in the tunnels. I took Billy\u2019s cage and ran too. 6. I ran through the tunnel as fast as I could. But my head hurt and I couldn\u2019t breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn\u2019t tell where it was coming from. \u201cCome on, boy!\u201d it said. Somebody picked me up. I turned around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy\u2019s cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn\u2019t just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, \u201cWho warned us?\u201d \u201cMe!\u201d I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. \u201cSilent Jonas found his voice!\u201d a miner shouted. But how could I feel happy? My friend Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small \u2018Tweet\u2019. Billy was alive! I opened the cage \u2026 There were canaries in mines until 1987. Today miners use machines to find out if there is gas in the mine.   The Norman conquest The old king of England, Edward, died in 1066. He had no children and both his Anglo-Saxon brother-in-law, Harold, and his French cousin, William, Duke of Normandy, wanted to be the next king of England. Harold made himself king, and William was very angry. So what did he do next? He sailed to England with his army \u2026 Harold and William fought the battle on Senlac Hill, near Hastings. William\u2019s men were knights and they were better trained. They fought on horses and were good archers. Harold\u2019s men fought on foot and they were already tired from an earlier battle at Stamford Bridge, 200 miles away in the north of England. (Yes, they had to walk those 200 miles!) How do we know what happened during the Battle of Hastings? Well, we have the 70-metre long Bayeux Tapestry to tell us! The tapestry is like a comic and it tells the story of the battle. It tells us that Harold died when he got an arrow in his eye, but we don\u2019t know if this really happened. William won the Battle of Hastings and he became king of England on Christmas Day 1066. Today we know him as William the Conqueror. He was a big castle fan and built lots of them in England, including part of the Tower of London. He also took land from the Anglo-Saxons and gave it to his Norman friends. Did the Normans change England? Yes, of course they did! For example, they brought many new words to the English language. Words like \u2018pork\u2019 and \u2018garden\u2019 come from this time. Guess what? There are still many English people who have Norman surnames, like Archer or Darcy. Before the Normans came to England, most people didn\u2019t even have surnames. They lived in small villages, so a first name or a nickname was often enough. ___ conquest \u2013 Eroberung ; the Anglo-Saxons \u2013 die Angelsachsen (das Volk, das schon vor 1066 in England lebte) ; brother-in-law \u2013 Schwager ; duke \u2013 Herzog ; army \u2013 Heer; Armee ; knight \u2013 Ritter ; archer \u2013 Bogensch\u00fctze; Bogensch\u00fctzin ; tapestry \u2013 Wandteppich ; surname \u2013 Nachname; Familienname   The RNLI: Volunteers on the coast The RNLI is the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. It\u2019s a charity and it saves lives at sea. The RNLI has 237 lifeboat stations and about 4,600 crew members in the UK and Ireland. The RNLI rescues about 8,000 people per year. The RNLI has saved about 140,000 lives since 1824. Many of the lifeboat crew members are volunteers. The RNLI gets money from fundraising. 18th June 2016, by Simon Spade Yesterday the RNLI rescued two teenage boys who got into trouble when they were kayaking off the coast near Llandudno. The two 14-year-old boys went out too far in their kayaks and could not get back to the beach because of strong winds. They tried to get back for more than two and a half hours, then shouted for help and waved. A tourist spotted the boys and made an emergency call to the RNLI. The lifeboat crew left their station at 1:40 p.m. and got to the kayaks in only a few minutes. The RNLI crew picked up the boys and gave them blankets and hot drinks to keep them warm. Lifeboat helm Howard Link called the ambulance to meet them on the beach. Both boys were very weak and seasick. They both spent the night in Llandudno hospital but are back home now. The lifeboat crew got back to their station at 3:25 p.m. There are some rules to remember when you go to the beach: S pot the dangers. A lways go with a friend or adult.

Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy \u2013 after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world\u2019s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren\u2019t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is \u2018fracking\u2019, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, \u201cFracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.\u201d But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada\u2019s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the end of this yet,\u201d says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. \u201cCO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.\u201d 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven\u2019t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won\u2019t change. \u201cWhat worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.\u201d Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable \u2013 which means that when we have used them up, there simply won\u2019t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada\u2019s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better \u2013 and we will have to.   The sound of ice I\u2019m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn\u2019t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship\u2019s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the \u2018northwest passage\u2019, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn\u2019t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship\u2019s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It\u2019s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn\u2019t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we\u2019d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn\u2019t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn\u2019t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back\u2019s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can\u2019t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let\u2019s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I\u2019m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown.

The Body In \u201cThe Body\u201d, Gordie Lachance and his three friends learn that a boy from their area, in the state of Maine, has disappeared and is probably dead. They decide to go on a trip to find the boy\u2019s body and prepare for the trip. The Gun My room was on the second floor, and it was really hot up there. I was glad I wasn\u2019t sleeping there that night, and the thought of where we were going made me excited again. I rolled up two blankets and tied an old belt around them. I grabbed all my money, which was less than a dollar. Then I was ready to go. I went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad. I was walking up Carbine Street towards the clubhouse when Chris caught up with me. His eyes were shining. \u201cGordie! You want to see something?\u201d \u201cSure. What?\u201d \u201cCome down here first.\u201d He pointed down an alley between two shops. \u201cWhat is it, Chris?\u201d \u201cCome on, I said!\u201d He ran down the alley and I ran after him. At the bottom, the smell from the trash was terrible. \u201cChris, I\u2019m going to puke, I\u2019m \u2013 \u201d But I forgot about the smell when Chris put his hand into his backpack and pulled out a big gun. \u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d \u201cFrom my dad\u2019s desk.\u201d \u201cMan, your dad\u2019s going to beat you when he finds out.\u201d Chris\u2019s eyes just went on dancing. \u201cHe isn\u2019t going to find out. He and his friends have got enough wine to keep them drunk for a week. I\u2019ll put it back before then.\u201d Chris hated alcohol \u2013 he\u2019d already seen too much of what it can do. He was the only one of us who didn\u2019t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they\u2019d stolen from their father. \u201cHave you got bullets for it?\u201d \u201cNine of them \u2013 all that was left in the box. He\u2019ll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.\u201d \u201cAny in it at the moment?\u201d \u201cNo, of course not. What do you think I am?\u201d I finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA \u2013 BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin \u2013 it was the work of an evil magician. \u201cWow!\u201d I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn\u2019t tell if he was amused or scared. \u201cYou did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!\u201d \u201cShut up! Let\u2019s go!\u201d I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. \u201cMan, it\u2019s a pity you couldn\u2019t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.\u201d \u201cYou knew there was a bullet in it, didn\u2019t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad\u2019s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.\u201d Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, \u201cWhat do you think we need a gun for?\u201d \u201cNothing, really,\u201d Chris said. \u201cExcept we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it\u2019s frightening out in the forest at night.\u201d Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?\u201d Teddy asked Vern. \u201cYeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it\u2019ll look as if we\u2019re there after dark.\u201d \u201cHey, man, great!\u201d I said, and slapped Vern on the back. For him, that was real thinking. He grinned. \u201cSo let\u2019s go,\u201d Teddy said. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly twelve already.\u201d Chris stood up and we gathered round him. \u201cWe\u2019ll walk across Beeman\u2019s field,\u201d he said, \u201cand then we\u2019ll get to the railway tracks and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.\u201d \u201cHow far is it, do you think?\u201d Teddy asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Chris. \u201cHarlow\u2019s big. We\u2019re going to have to walk at least twenty miles. Does that sound right to you, Gordie?\u201d \u201cYeah. Maybe more \u2013 thirty miles.\u201d \u201cCome on, you guys,\u201d Chris said, and picked up his backpack, blankets and water bottle.   Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? headline written by Pam Warner (published 07\/12\/16 in Health & Style ) author, date, source What is your Thanksgiving like? Turkey and pumpkin pie? American football on the sofa? In the last couple of years a new trend has become popular in the USA: More people like to eat better quality food and live a more active life. introduction It is slowly going out of fashion to live off convenience and frozen food. A number of people shop for organic food at special supermarkets instead. In some states farmers\u2019 markets offer a great variety of fresh vegetables and fruit from the region. \u201cThere are also dairy products, bread and meat without chemical additives at these markets. Organic food is not only much healthier but it tastes a lot better as well,\u201d explains Emma from Boston. So how about some healthy recipes for Thanksgiving? Maybe pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes? A roast turkey breast or a turkey roulade filled with apples and cranberries is delicious too. But there\u2019s more to a healthy lifestyle than just food. A lot of trend sports show that you can have fun, spend time with friends and stay fit at the same time. Have you found the right sport for you yet? If not, here is a suggestion: How about standup paddleboarding? If you like water, that\u2019s the ideal kind of sport for you. You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: \u201cDrinking too much alcohol isn\u2019t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?\u201d Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don\u2019t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion"}

The Titanic disaster The Belfast News Wednesday, 17th April 1912 TWO DAYS AFTER \u2013 MORE FACTS The giant ship Titanic, which was built here in Belfast\u2019s shipyard, hit an iceberg on 14th April, shortly before midnight. Water filled the ship until it sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD\u2019S LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship\u2019s builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. LOCAL MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland. The ship\u2019s doctor, Dr John Simpson, 37, was born in Belfast. His mother was optimistic when a letter from him arrived at her home yesterday. However, we have found out that he posted the letter during the ship\u2019s last stop. We now know that Dr Simpson did not survive. DOG SAVES LIVES Some were lucky and the ships which came to save the passengers of the Titanic found their lifeboat. According to a passenger, one of the dogs on board saved the lives of the people in one lifeboat. A ship only found this lifeboat in the dark night and the foggy weather because they heard the dog when it barked. HOW COULD IT HAPPEN? After the sinking of the Titanic a number of questions still need answers. Why did no one see the iceberg? Why did the ship break? Why were there only 20 lifeboats for 2,200 people on board? Why did lifeboats leave the ship when they were not yet full? And how can we make sure that an accident like this will never happen again? About 700 people survived the accident. Some ships today have over 6,500 passengers and crew. After the Titanic\u2019s accident there were laws that ships must have one lifeboat place for every person on board. Dr Simpson\u2019s last letter to his mother is now in the Belfast Titanic museum.   A deadly silence 1. My name is Jonas Fox and I\u2019m twelve years old. I work in the mines and my job is to sit near a door in the tunnel every day. I must open the door when the coal arrives. Then, after it\u2019s gone, I quickly close the door again. Every day I sit in the dark, but I\u2019m never scared. That\u2019s because my friend Billy is always there with me. Billy sings all day long. He\u2019s yellow with little black eyes which look like they are made of glass. Billy is a canary, you see? It\u2019s never boring with Billy around. I would love to sing too, but I can\u2019t even talk. 2. Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine killed 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there\u2019s gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine. One day Bart started to cough and he never stopped coughing after that. Then one night my brother coughed so badly that he died. That was when I stopped talking. I don\u2019t know why, really. I still had words in my head and I opened my mouth, but I couldn\u2019t speak. The men in the mine started to call me \u2018Silent Jonas\u2019 after that. They probably thought I was a bit strange. 4. The day when things got really bad started like any other. Billy was singing like he always did. I heard the people in the tunnels and the noise of the coal trucks. I opened the door and I felt a cold wind in the tunnel. I closed the door again. Billy stopped singing. For a moment I didn\u2019t understand. But then, suddenly, I did: There was gas in the mine! And it could explode any second. I didn\u2019t have time to run down the tunnel to warn the men. If only I could talk, if only I could shout! 5. I knew I had to warn everyone in the mine. So I opened my mouth and tried to say it: \u201cGas.\u201d But there was no sound. Nothing came out. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth again. Nothing. I panicked. We could die in here \u2013 I had to speak! I tried again. This time the sound was quiet, but I made a sound. At last! I opened the door and shouted, \u201cGas. Gas. GAS!\u201d A moment later I heard the sound of the miners\u2019 boots in the tunnels. I took Billy\u2019s cage and ran too. 6. I ran through the tunnel as fast as I could. But my head hurt and I couldn\u2019t breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn\u2019t tell where it was coming from. \u201cCome on, boy!\u201d it said. Somebody picked me up. I turned around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy\u2019s cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn\u2019t just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, \u201cWho warned us?\u201d \u201cMe!\u201d I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. \u201cSilent Jonas found his voice!\u201d a miner shouted. But how could I feel happy? My friend Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small \u2018Tweet\u2019. Billy was alive! I opened the cage \u2026 There were canaries in mines until 1987. Today miners use machines to find out if there is gas in the mine.   The Norman conquest The old king of England, Edward, died in 1066. He had no children and both his Anglo-Saxon brother-in-law, Harold, and his French cousin, William, Duke of Normandy, wanted to be the next king of England. Harold made himself king, and William was very angry. So what did he do next? He sailed to England with his army \u2026 Harold and William fought the battle on Senlac Hill, near Hastings. William\u2019s men were knights and they were better trained. They fought on horses and were good archers. Harold\u2019s men fought on foot and they were already tired from an earlier battle at Stamford Bridge, 200 miles away in the north of England. (Yes, they had to walk those 200 miles!) How do we know what happened during the Battle of Hastings? Well, we have the 70-metre long Bayeux Tapestry to tell us! The tapestry is like a comic and it tells the story of the battle. It tells us that Harold died when he got an arrow in his eye, but we don\u2019t know if this really happened. William won the Battle of Hastings and he became king of England on Christmas Day 1066. Today we know him as William the Conqueror. He was a big castle fan and built lots of them in England, including part of the Tower of London. He also took land from the Anglo-Saxons and gave it to his Norman friends. Did the Normans change England? Yes, of course they did! For example, they brought many new words to the English language. Words like \u2018pork\u2019 and \u2018garden\u2019 come from this time. Guess what? There are still many English people who have Norman surnames, like Archer or Darcy. Before the Normans came to England, most people didn\u2019t even have surnames. They lived in small villages, so a first name or a nickname was often enough. ___ conquest \u2013 Eroberung ; the Anglo-Saxons \u2013 die Angelsachsen (das Volk, das schon vor 1066 in England lebte) ; brother-in-law \u2013 Schwager ; duke \u2013 Herzog ; army \u2013 Heer; Armee ; knight \u2013 Ritter ; archer \u2013 Bogensch\u00fctze; Bogensch\u00fctzin ; tapestry \u2013 Wandteppich ; surname \u2013 Nachname; Familienname   The RNLI: Volunteers on the coast The RNLI is the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.

The RNLI has saved about 140,000 lives since 1824. Many of the lifeboat crew members are volunteers. The RNLI gets money from fundraising. 18th June 2016, by Simon Spade Yesterday the RNLI rescued two teenage boys who got into trouble when they were kayaking off the coast near Llandudno. The two 14-year-old boys went out too far in their kayaks and could not get back to the beach because of strong winds. They tried to get back for more than two and a half hours, then shouted for help and waved. A tourist spotted the boys and made an emergency call to the RNLI. The lifeboat crew left their station at 1:40 p.m. and got to the kayaks in only a few minutes. The RNLI crew picked up the boys and gave them blankets and hot drinks to keep them warm. Lifeboat helm Howard Link called the ambulance to meet them on the beach. Both boys were very weak and seasick. They both spent the night in Llandudno hospital but are back home now.

The Titanic disaster The Belfast News Wednesday, 17th April 1912 TWO DAYS AFTER \u2013 MORE FACTS The giant ship Titanic, which was built here in Belfast\u2019s shipyard, hit an iceberg on 14th April, shortly before midnight. Water filled the ship until it sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD\u2019S LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship\u2019s builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. LOCAL MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland. The ship\u2019s doctor, Dr John Simpson, 37, was born in Belfast. His mother was optimistic when a letter from him arrived at her home yesterday. However, we have found out that he posted the letter during the ship\u2019s last stop. We now know that Dr Simpson did not survive. DOG SAVES LIVES Some were lucky and the ships which came to save the passengers of the Titanic found their lifeboat. According to a passenger, one of the dogs on board saved the lives of the people in one lifeboat. A ship only found this lifeboat in the dark night and the foggy weather because they heard the dog when it barked. HOW COULD IT HAPPEN? After the sinking of the Titanic a number of questions still need answers. Why did no one see the iceberg? Why did the ship break? Why were there only 20 lifeboats for 2,200 people on board? Why did lifeboats leave the ship when they were not yet full? And how can we make sure that an accident like this will never happen again? About 700 people survived the accident. Some ships today have over 6,500 passengers and crew. After the Titanic\u2019s accident there were laws that ships must have one lifeboat place for every person on board. Dr Simpson\u2019s last letter to his mother is now in the Belfast Titanic museum.   A deadly silence 1. My name is Jonas Fox and I\u2019m twelve years old. I work in the mines and my job is to sit near a door in the tunnel every day. I must open the door when the coal arrives. Then, after it\u2019s gone, I quickly close the door again. Every day I sit in the dark, but I\u2019m never scared. That\u2019s because my friend Billy is always there with me. Billy sings all day long. He\u2019s yellow with little black eyes which look like they are made of glass. Billy is a canary, you see? It\u2019s never boring with Billy around. I would love to sing too, but I can\u2019t even talk. 2. Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine killed 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there\u2019s gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine. One day Bart started to cough and he never stopped coughing after that. Then one night my brother coughed so badly that he died. That was when I stopped talking. I don\u2019t know why, really. I still had words in my head and I opened my mouth, but I couldn\u2019t speak. The men in the mine started to call me \u2018Silent Jonas\u2019 after that. They probably thought I was a bit strange. 4. The day when things got really bad started like any other. Billy was singing like he always did. I heard the people in the tunnels and the noise of the coal trucks. I opened the door and I felt a cold wind in the tunnel. I closed the door again. Billy stopped singing. For a moment I didn\u2019t understand. But then, suddenly, I did: There was gas in the mine! And it could explode any second. I didn\u2019t have time to run down the tunnel to warn the men. If only I could talk, if only I could shout! 5. I knew I had to warn everyone in the mine. So I opened my mouth and tried to say it: \u201cGas.\u201d But there was no sound. Nothing came out. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth again. Nothing. I panicked. We could die in here \u2013 I had to speak! I tried again. This time the sound was quiet, but I made a sound. At last! I opened the door and shouted, \u201cGas. Gas. GAS!\u201d A moment later I heard the sound of the miners\u2019 boots in the tunnels. I took Billy\u2019s cage and ran too. 6. I ran through the tunnel as fast as I could. But my head hurt and I couldn\u2019t breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn\u2019t tell where it was coming from. \u201cCome on, boy!\u201d it said. Somebody picked me up. I turned around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy\u2019s cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn\u2019t just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, \u201cWho warned us?\u201d \u201cMe!\u201d I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. \u201cSilent Jonas found his voice!\u201d a miner shouted. But how could I feel happy? My friend Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small \u2018Tweet\u2019. Billy was alive! I opened the cage \u2026 There were canaries in mines until 1987. Today miners use machines to find out if there is gas in the mine.   The Norman conquest The old king of England, Edward, died in 1066. He had no children and both his Anglo-Saxon brother-in-law, Harold, and his French cousin, William, Duke of Normandy, wanted to be the next king of England. Harold made himself king, and William was very angry. So what did he do next? He sailed to England with his army \u2026 Harold and William fought the battle on Senlac Hill, near Hastings. William\u2019s men were knights and they were better trained. They fought on horses and were good archers. Harold\u2019s men fought on foot and they were already tired from an earlier battle at Stamford Bridge, 200 miles away in the north of England. (Yes, they had to walk those 200 miles!) How do we know what happened during the Battle of Hastings? Well, we have the 70-metre long Bayeux Tapestry to tell us! The tapestry is like a comic and it tells the story of the battle. It tells us that Harold died when he got an arrow in his eye, but we don\u2019t know if this really happened. William won the Battle of Hastings and he became king of England on Christmas Day 1066. Today we know him as William the Conqueror. He was a big castle fan and built lots of them in England, including part of the Tower of London. He also took land from the Anglo-Saxons and gave it to his Norman friends. Did the Normans change England? Yes, of course they did! For example, they brought many new words to the English language. Words like \u2018pork\u2019 and \u2018garden\u2019 come from this time. Guess what? There are still many English people who have Norman surnames, like Archer or Darcy. Before the Normans came to England, most people didn\u2019t even have surnames. They lived in small villages, so a first name or a nickname was often enough. ___ conquest \u2013 Eroberung ; the Anglo-Saxons \u2013 die Angelsachsen (das Volk, das schon vor 1066 in England lebte) ; brother-in-law \u2013 Schwager ; duke \u2013 Herzog ; army \u2013 Heer; Armee ; knight \u2013 Ritter ; archer \u2013 Bogensch\u00fctze; Bogensch\u00fctzin ; tapestry \u2013 Wandteppich ; surname \u2013 Nachname; Familienname   The RNLI: Volunteers on the coast The RNLI is the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. It\u2019s a charity and it saves lives at sea. The RNLI has 237 lifeboat stations and about 4,600 crew members in the UK and Ireland. The RNLI rescues about 8,000 people per year. The RNLI has saved about 140,000 lives since 1824. Many of the lifeboat crew members are volunteers. The RNLI gets money from fundraising. 18th June 2016, by Simon Spade Yesterday the RNLI rescued two teenage boys who got into trouble when they were kayaking off the coast near Llandudno. The two 14-year-old boys went out too far in their kayaks and could not get back to the beach because of strong winds. They tried to get back for more than two and a half hours, then shouted for help and waved. A tourist spotted the boys and made an emergency call to the RNLI. The lifeboat crew left their station at 1:40 p.m. and got to the kayaks in only a few minutes. The RNLI crew picked up the boys and gave them blankets and hot drinks to keep them warm. Lifeboat helm Howard Link called the ambulance to meet them on the beach. Both boys were very weak and seasick. They both spent the night in Llandudno hospital but are back home now. The lifeboat crew got back to their station at 3:25 p.m. There are some rules to remember when you go to the beach: S pot the dangers. A lways go with a friend or adult.

We can do even better \u2013 by Lindsay Fern (21\/1\/2017) 1. Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy \u2013 after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world\u2019s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren\u2019t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is \u2018fracking\u2019, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, \u201cFracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.\u201d But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada\u2019s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the end of this yet,\u201d says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. \u201cCO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.\u201d 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven\u2019t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won\u2019t change. \u201cWhat worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.\u201d Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable \u2013 which means that when we have used them up, there simply won\u2019t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada\u2019s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better \u2013 and we will have to.   The sound of ice I\u2019m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn\u2019t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship\u2019s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the \u2018northwest passage\u2019, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn\u2019t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship\u2019s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It\u2019s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn\u2019t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we\u2019d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn\u2019t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn\u2019t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back\u2019s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can\u2019t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let\u2019s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I\u2019m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown.

But my head hurt and I couldn\u2019t breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn\u2019t tell where it was coming from. \u201cCome on, boy!\u201d it said. Somebody picked me up. I turned around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy\u2019s cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn\u2019t just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, \u201cWho warned us?\u201d \u201cMe!\u201d I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. \u201cSilent Jonas found his voice!\u201d a miner shouted. But how could I feel happy? My friend Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small \u2018Tweet\u2019. Billy was alive! I opened the cage \u2026 There were canaries in mines until 1987. Today miners use machines to find out if there is gas in the mine."}

What can you say in Swiss German, German or French to get the same effect?","negative":"Clara\u2019s letter: Find out \u2026   about their problem.    We can do even better \u2013 by Lindsay Fern (21\/1\/2017) 1. Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy \u2013 after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world\u2019s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren\u2019t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is \u2018fracking\u2019, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, \u201cFracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.\u201d But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada\u2019s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the end of this yet,\u201d says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. \u201cCO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.\u201d 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven\u2019t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won\u2019t change. \u201cWhat worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.\u201d Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable \u2013 which means that when we have used them up, there simply won\u2019t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada\u2019s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better \u2013 and we will have to.   The sound of ice I\u2019m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn\u2019t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship\u2019s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the \u2018northwest passage\u2019, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn\u2019t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship\u2019s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It\u2019s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn\u2019t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we\u2019d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn\u2019t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn\u2019t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back\u2019s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can\u2019t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let\u2019s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I\u2019m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown. Stephen Samuel Stanley \u2013 ship\u2019s doctor, HMS Erebus   In New Zealand   Working in India Get to know India and work as a volunteer Teaching young children in an orphanage in Jaipur Building and repairing schools in Goa Helping stray dogs in Ranchi For more information contact Mrs Lal. (a.lal@vii.com) My name is Emma De Santis. I\u2019m from Germany and I\u2019m 18 years old. I took part in a project at an orphanage in Jaipur last year. My English isn\u2019t bad and I used to work as a babysitter for our neighbours\u2019 kids. I could choose to work from four weeks to ten months. I decided to stay for eight weeks. Before I went to India, I had to get all the important papers. I also knew that I would have to pay the organization almost \u20ac2,000. The flight was not included. So I decided to work in a supermarket to earn the money. When I got the contract for the project in India, I booked my flight and I was ready to go. When I arrived in Jaipur, I was very tired from the journey and the time difference. The heat, the noise and the smells made it even worse. But I still remember a cow lying in front of the phone shop. During the orientation days I met other volunteers from different countries, which was great. After that I met my host family. They were very friendly people. However, I was homesick during the first days, and I had some problems with the food. It was so spicy. At the time I thought, \u201cIf I don\u2019t feel better soon, I\u2019ll have to quit.\u201d But I got over it quickly. My job was great but challenging too. The working conditions were OK. I was teaching 10-year-old girls English and organizing some free-time activities for the younger ones. The staff were very helpful. They all spoke English, which made things a little easier. I quickly found out that things are different in India. Most people\u2019s attitude in India is \u201cWhatever happens, happens.\u201d And usually that\u2019s OK for everyone. Wherever I went, people were smiling at me. But they didn\u2019t just show interest in me, many of them actually stared at me. But you learn to ignore it. I can really recommend taking part in a project like this. I met wonderful people, made new friends and learned a lot about myself. If you go to India, you\u2019ll never forget it.   \u2018I have a dream\u2019 - Martin Luther King, Jr. On April 4, 1968 the African-American minister 1 and US civil rights 2 leader Martin Luther King, Junior was shot in Memphis, Tennessee. The week after his death there were violent protests in cities across the United States. But who was this man whose death shook both a nation and also people around the rest of the world? King was born in the American South, in Atlanta, Georgia, on January 15, 1929. He grew up in a religious family. His father was a Baptist pastor and his mother was a church organist. At that time the people in the American South were segregated 3 . Laws made sure that in the Southern states African-American people did not have the same rights as whites. They had to go to different schools and eat in different restaurants. They weren\u2019t allowed to work with white people. African Americans had to sit at the back of buses and give up their seats to white people. King never wanted to accept this segregation. When he was little, his best friend was a white boy. King, however, had to go to a school for African Americans, while his friend went to a school for whites. So King lost his friend. Over the years King realized how unfair his family and neighbors were treated. He wanted to fight for the civil rights of African Americans. At the age of 18 King decided to become a minister. He felt that the church could give him the best chance to help people and society. He finished college in 1951. He got married to his girlfriend Coretta Scott in 1953, and together they had four children. A year later he became pastor of a Baptist church in Montgomery, Alabama. Protests against racial segregation began in 1955. African-American Rosa Parks hadn\u2019t wanted to give up her bus seat to white people in the city of Montgomery. Rosa Parks was arrested. King started a campaign 4 . For 381 days people didn\u2019t use the city\u2019s public transportation. The campaign was led by Martin Luther King, Jr. During this time his house was bombed and he was arrested too. In the end racial segregation on all Montgomery public transportation was made illegal 5 . It was the first victory 6 for the Civil Rights Movement and it made King a very famous person. In 1957 King and other civil rights activists founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). They wanted to use non-violent protests to achieve 7 civil rights reform. King was influenced by Mahatma Gandhi and his successful non-violent protest against the British Empire in the 1940s. The SCLC started a campaign against racial segregation in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963. Everything was peaceful until the police used water cannons and police dogs against the protesters, even against children. When this was shown on national TV, many white Americans were shocked. The Birmingham campaign was successful and African Americans now had more access 8 to public places. \u2018White Only\u2019 and \u2018Black Only\u2019 signs were removed from restrooms 9 , for example. Early in the Birmingham campaign, King had been arrested again. In his cell he realized that freedom for African-American people would be a long and hard struggle 10 . Later that year King helped organize the March on Washington on August 28, 1963. Its goal was to protest against the way African Americans were treated in Southern states. The protesters wanted an end to racial segregation in schools and at work. They also wanted to protect workers from police brutality. More than 250,000 people joined the march. At the time it was the largest meeting of protesters in the history of Washington, D.C. During this event King gave his most famous speech \u2013 \u2018I have a dream\u2019. It became one of the greatest American speeches. Soon after, civil rights became the most important goal for black and white reformers in the United States. Most of the civil rights became law in 1964 and 1965. King got the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 for his role in the Civil Rights Movement. He was also named \u2018Person of the Year\u2019 by Time magazine. In March 1968 King went to Memphis, Tennessee. He wanted to support African-American workers there who were on strike 11 against bad working conditions. On April 4, 1968 he was shot. James Earl Ray, a white escaped convict 12 , was arrested and was sentenced 13 to 99 years in prison. Since 1983 the third Monday in January has become a national holiday 14 in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. The house where King was born and his grave in Atlanta are national monuments. Streets in towns and cities all over the United States have been named after him. King was the leader of the Civil Rights Movement for almost 13 years. During that time African Americans made a lot of progress on the way towards equality 15 in America. However, many black Americans still experience racial discrimination today. King is known as one of the greatest non-violent leaders in world history. ___ 1 minister [\u02c8m\u026an\u026ast\u0259] \u2212 Pfarrer, Pfarrerin ; 2 civil rights [\u02ccs\u026avl \u02c8ra\u026ats] \u2212 B\u00fcrgerrechte ; 3 segregated [\u02c8segr\u026age\u026at\u026ad] \u2212 getrennt (nach Hautfarbe) ; 4 campaign [k\u04d5\u02c8pe\u026an] \u2212 Kampagne, Aktion ; 5 illegal [\u026a\u02c8li:gl] \u2212 illegal, gesetzeswidrig ; 6 victory [\u02c8v\u026aktri] \u2212 Sieg ; 7 to achieve [\u0259\u02c8t\u222bi:v] \u2212 erreichen ; 8 access [\u02c8\u04d5kses] \u2212 Zugang, Zutritt ; 9 restroom [\u02c8rest\u02ccr\u028am] \u2212 Toilette ; 10 struggle [\u02c8str\u028cgl] \u2212 Kampf ; 11 to be on strike [\u0252n \u02c8stra\u026ak] \u2212 streiken ; 12 escaped convict [\u026a\u02ccske\u026apd \u02c8k\u0252nv\u026akt] \u2212 fl\u00fcchtiger Str\u00e4fling ; 13 to sentence [\u02c8sent\u0259ns] \u2212 verurteilen ; 14 national holiday [\u02ccn\u04d5\u222bnl \u02c8h\u0252l\u0259de\u026a] \u2212 (nationaler) Feiertag ; 15 equality [\u026a\u02c8kw\u0252l\u0259ti] \u2212 Gleichheit   What should I do?

Danny is the coolest guy in the world \u2013 and he\u2019s so cute. We\u2019ve been together since last April. I still go to school in Christchurch, but Danny left school two months ago. I thought he was only looking for a job in Christchurch. Then last week, while we were walking to the cinema, he told me that he got a job as an apprentice chef at a hotel in Wellington. He told me after he had already accepted the job. I was so upset! Danny said that there were no jobs here and he really needed one. We could video chat every day and he would come back to Christchurch whenever he could. But it takes a whole day to get to Wellington by train and ferry. That\u2019s too far! I really love Danny and I don\u2019t want to lose him. We belong together! I\u2019m thinking about leaving school and living with him in Wellington. Of course, my parents don\u2019t understand. We had a big argument and haven\u2019t really made up since. They just told me to concentrate on school. Please help me. I really need some advice. Clara RE: He didn\u2019t tell me. Linda ( online ) 16th June 2021, 8:55 Hello Clara, I understand how you feel. Danny means everything to you. You want to spend every minute with him. Now Danny made an important decision without discussing it with you first. That hurts, doesn\u2019t it? Maybe it\u2019s time to talk about what each of you really wants. Ask yourself: What do you want? What are you worried about? Is it really only because Wellington is so far away, or don\u2019t you trust your boyfriend? Are you afraid that he will cheat on you? How would you feel about breaking up? Whatever you do, don\u2019t make decisions now that you may not be happy about later. If you want to stay together, you could stay with Danny during the school holidays for a start. That might be OK for your parents. You could still move in with him later, after you\u2019ve finished school. Good luck! Linda"}

The Body In \u201cThe Body\u201d, Gordie Lachance and his three friends learn that a boy from their area, in the state of Maine, has disappeared and is probably dead. They decide to go on a trip to find the boy\u2019s body and prepare for the trip. The Gun My room was on the second floor, and it was really hot up there. I was glad I wasn\u2019t sleeping there that night, and the thought of where we were going made me excited again. I rolled up two blankets and tied an old belt around them. I grabbed all my money, which was less than a dollar. Then I was ready to go. I went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad. I was walking up Carbine Street towards the clubhouse when Chris caught up with me. His eyes were shining. \u201cGordie! You want to see something?\u201d \u201cSure. What?\u201d \u201cCome down here first.\u201d He pointed down an alley between two shops. \u201cWhat is it, Chris?\u201d \u201cCome on, I said!\u201d He ran down the alley and I ran after him. At the bottom, the smell from the trash was terrible. \u201cChris, I\u2019m going to puke, I\u2019m \u2013 \u201d But I forgot about the smell when Chris put his hand into his backpack and pulled out a big gun. \u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d \u201cFrom my dad\u2019s desk.\u201d \u201cMan, your dad\u2019s going to beat you when he finds out.\u201d Chris\u2019s eyes just went on dancing. \u201cHe isn\u2019t going to find out. He and his friends have got enough wine to keep them drunk for a week. I\u2019ll put it back before then.\u201d Chris hated alcohol \u2013 he\u2019d already seen too much of what it can do. He was the only one of us who didn\u2019t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they\u2019d stolen from their father. \u201cHave you got bullets for it?\u201d \u201cNine of them \u2013 all that was left in the box. He\u2019ll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.\u201d \u201cAny in it at the moment?\u201d \u201cNo, of course not. What do you think I am?\u201d I finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA \u2013 BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin \u2013 it was the work of an evil magician. \u201cWow!\u201d I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn\u2019t tell if he was amused or scared. \u201cYou did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!\u201d \u201cShut up! Let\u2019s go!\u201d I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. \u201cMan, it\u2019s a pity you couldn\u2019t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.\u201d \u201cYou knew there was a bullet in it, didn\u2019t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad\u2019s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.\u201d Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, \u201cWhat do you think we need a gun for?\u201d \u201cNothing, really,\u201d Chris said. \u201cExcept we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it\u2019s frightening out in the forest at night.\u201d Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?\u201d Teddy asked Vern. \u201cYeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it\u2019ll look as if we\u2019re there after dark.\u201d \u201cHey, man, great!\u201d I said, and slapped Vern on the back. For him, that was real thinking. He grinned. \u201cSo let\u2019s go,\u201d Teddy said. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly twelve already.\u201d Chris stood up and we gathered round him. \u201cWe\u2019ll walk across Beeman\u2019s field,\u201d he said, \u201cand then we\u2019ll get to the railway tracks and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.\u201d \u201cHow far is it, do you think?\u201d Teddy asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Chris. \u201cHarlow\u2019s big.

Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? headline written by Pam Warner (published 07\/12\/16 in Health & Style ) author, date, source What is your Thanksgiving like? Turkey and pumpkin pie? American football on the sofa? In the last couple of years a new trend has become popular in the USA: More people like to eat better quality food and live a more active life. introduction It is slowly going out of fashion to live off convenience and frozen food. A number of people shop for organic food at special supermarkets instead. In some states farmers\u2019 markets offer a great variety of fresh vegetables and fruit from the region. \u201cThere are also dairy products, bread and meat without chemical additives at these markets. Organic food is not only much healthier but it tastes a lot better as well,\u201d explains Emma from Boston. So how about some healthy recipes for Thanksgiving? Maybe pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes? A roast turkey breast or a turkey roulade filled with apples and cranberries is delicious too. But there\u2019s more to a healthy lifestyle than just food. A lot of trend sports show that you can have fun, spend time with friends and stay fit at the same time. Have you found the right sport for you yet? If not, here is a suggestion: How about standup paddleboarding? If you like water, that\u2019s the ideal kind of sport for you. You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: \u201cDrinking too much alcohol isn\u2019t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?\u201d Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don\u2019t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion   A first date Dylan often thought about Abby. He really liked her. But he was too shy to ask her out on a date. Dylan\u2019s friend Forget her. She\u2019s not interested in you. She has a boyfriend. One day his books fell out of his locker right when Abby showed up. With Scott in tow, of course. How embarrassing. Scott Who\u2019s that guy? Look at him! A few days later they had lunch together. Dylan helped Abby with her Science project. They didn\u2019t notice Scott and his football friends. Scott\u2019s friend Isn\u2019t she your girlfriend? Dylan Let me explain. It\u2019s not that hard! When Dylan went to the gym, the boys attacked him. Scott pushed him really hard and Dylan couldn\u2019t do anything about it. Scott Stay away from her! Abby Stop it! You\u2019re hurting him!

Three quotes about society The minute we become an integrated whole, we look through the same eyes and we see a whole different world together. ___ Azizah Al-Hibri, American philosopher and legal scholar Peace is not unity in similarity but unity in diversity, in the comparison and conciliation of differences. ___ Mikhail Gorbachev, former Russian president Unlike a drop of water which loses its identity when it joins the ocean, man does not lose his being in the society in which he lives. Man\u2019s life is independent. He is born not for the development of the society alone, but for the development of his self. ___ B. R. Ambedkar, former Indian Minister of Law and Justice   The House on Mango Street My name In English my name means hope. In Spanish it means too many letters. It means sadness, it means waiting. It is like the number nine. A muddy color. It is the Mexican records my father plays on Sunday mornings when he is shaving, songs like sobbing. It was my great-grandmother\u2019s name and now it is mine. She was a horse woman too, born like me in the Chinese year of the horse \u2013 which is supposed 1 to be bad luck if you\u2019re born female \u2013 but I think this is a Chinese lie because the Chinese, like the Mexicans, don\u2019t like their women strong. My great-grandmother. I would\u2019ve liked to have known her, a wild horse of a woman, so wild she wouldn\u2019t marry. Until my great-grandfather threw a sack over her head and carried her off. Just like that, as if she were a fancy chandelier 2 . That\u2019s the way he did it. And the story goes she never forgave him. She looked out the window her whole life, the way so many women sit their sadness on an elbow. I wonder if she made the best with what she got or was she sorry because she couldn\u2019t be all the things she wanted to be. Esperanza. I have inherited her name, but I don\u2019t want to inherit her place by the window. At school they say my name funny as if the syllables were made out of tin and hurt the roof of your mouth. But in Spanish my name is made out of a softer something, like silver, not quite as thick as my sister\u2019s name \u2013 Magdalena \u2013 which is uglier than mine. Magdalena who at least can come home and become Nenny. But I am always Esperanza. I would like to baptize 3 myself under a new name, a name more like the real me, the one nobody sees. Esperanza as Lisandra or Maritza or Zeze the X. Yes. Something like Zeze the X will do. ___ From: Sandra Cisneros, The House on Mango Street , 2009 1 to suppose to believe; 2 chandelier [\u02cc\u0283\u00e6nd\u0259\u02c8l\u026a\u0259] Kronleuchter ; 3 to baptize taufen"}

Luke went home and phoned the bus company. They wanted to help but first they needed a special number from his phone \u2013 and he didn\u2019t know the number! Luke didn\u2019t enjoy his dinner at all that night. Why wasn\u2019t he more careful with his phone? Suddenly the doorbell rang. \u201cGwen\u2019s here!\u201d shouted Luke\u2019s mum from the hall.

And it\u2019s the place where dreams come true 1 . London is the place for me! Old woman I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s an awful place. (Dora looks down the road. There is the sound of a bus.)

I want to be with my friends. But I\u2019m not. Mum and Dad sent me to stay with Aunt Susan for six long days. To a village! In the middle of nowhere. All you can see are fields, trees and some animals. There are no shops, no caf\u00e9s and no buses. No skate park either! It\u2019s so boring! How can people live here? There was a party in the village this evening. But it wasn\u2019t fun. There was a barbecue 1 and then singing and dancing. But the music was awful. I was so bored that I turned their music off and played some hip-hop 2 instead. Everybody was mad and shouted at me. I laughed at them and left. I hate this place and I hate these people. How can birds be so loud? Some of them started singing at four in the morning! Later the church bells 3 rang 4 . Nothing happened today. Just another boring day. When can I go home? Nothing! Aunt Susan wanted me to help with the cows and in the garden, but I stayed in my room and watched films. The village boys tried to pick me up for a football game. I told them that I didn\u2019t have my football shoes and couldn\u2019t play. I can\u2019t believe what happened last night. I woke up in the middle of the night because there was a loud noise in the house. I went to the kitchen and saw Aunt Susan there. She was on the phone, and she was very excited. When she saw me, she told me to come with her. Rosalie needed help. I didn\u2019t know who Rosalie was. I was surprised when I saw that Rosalie was one of Aunt Susan\u2019s cows. She needed help with her calf. Some other people from the village were there too. They were all very calm and knew what to do. They told me to hold the light so that the vet could see well. I could hardly look. That noise! And it smelt terrible. Yuck! 5 Then it was there. A little calf. So sweet, so clumsy. We all felt very happy. I was so tired but so excited. I got up early again. I just had to see if the calf was OK. It was. It stood next to Rosalie and drank its milk. It\u2019s the most beautiful little cow I\u2019ve ever seen 6 . I think I\u2019ll ask Aunt Susan if I can come back again.

They decide to go on a trip to find the boy\u2019s body and prepare for the trip. The Gun My room was on the second floor, and it was really hot up there. I was glad I wasn\u2019t sleeping there that night, and the thought of where we were going made me excited again. I rolled up two blankets and tied an old belt around them. I grabbed all my money, which was less than a dollar. Then I was ready to go. I went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad. I was walking up Carbine Street towards the clubhouse when Chris caught up with me. His eyes were shining. \u201cGordie! You want to see something?\u201d \u201cSure. What?\u201d \u201cCome down here first.\u201d He pointed down an alley between two shops. \u201cWhat is it, Chris?\u201d \u201cCome on, I said!\u201d He ran down the alley and I ran after him. At the bottom, the smell from the trash was terrible. \u201cChris, I\u2019m going to puke, I\u2019m \u2013 \u201d But I forgot about the smell when Chris put his hand into his backpack and pulled out a big gun. \u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d \u201cFrom my dad\u2019s desk.\u201d \u201cMan, your dad\u2019s going to beat you when he finds out.\u201d Chris\u2019s eyes just went on dancing. \u201cHe isn\u2019t going to find out. He and his friends have got enough wine to keep them drunk for a week. I\u2019ll put it back before then.\u201d Chris hated alcohol \u2013 he\u2019d already seen too much of what it can do. He was the only one of us who didn\u2019t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they\u2019d stolen from their father. \u201cHave you got bullets for it?\u201d \u201cNine of them \u2013 all that was left in the box. He\u2019ll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.\u201d \u201cAny in it at the moment?\u201d \u201cNo, of course not. What do you think I am?\u201d I finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA \u2013 BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin \u2013 it was the work of an evil magician. \u201cWow!\u201d I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn\u2019t tell if he was amused or scared. \u201cYou did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!\u201d \u201cShut up! Let\u2019s go!\u201d I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. \u201cMan, it\u2019s a pity you couldn\u2019t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.\u201d \u201cYou knew there was a bullet in it, didn\u2019t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad\u2019s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.\u201d Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, \u201cWhat do you think we need a gun for?\u201d \u201cNothing, really,\u201d Chris said. \u201cExcept we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it\u2019s frightening out in the forest at night.\u201d Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?\u201d Teddy asked Vern. \u201cYeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it\u2019ll look as if we\u2019re there after dark.\u201d \u201cHey, man, great!\u201d I said, and slapped Vern on the back. For him, that was real thinking. He grinned. \u201cSo let\u2019s go,\u201d Teddy said. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly twelve already.\u201d Chris stood up and we gathered round him. \u201cWe\u2019ll walk across Beeman\u2019s field,\u201d he said, \u201cand then we\u2019ll get to the railway tracks and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.\u201d \u201cHow far is it, do you think?\u201d Teddy asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Chris. \u201cHarlow\u2019s big. We\u2019re going to have to walk at least twenty miles. Does that sound right to you, Gordie?\u201d \u201cYeah. Maybe more \u2013 thirty miles.\u201d \u201cCome on, you guys,\u201d Chris said, and picked up his backpack, blankets and water bottle.   Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? headline written by Pam Warner (published 07\/12\/16 in Health & Style ) author, date, source What is your Thanksgiving like? Turkey and pumpkin pie? American football on the sofa? In the last couple of years a new trend has become popular in the USA: More people like to eat better quality food and live a more active life. introduction It is slowly going out of fashion to live off convenience and frozen food. A number of people shop for organic food at special supermarkets instead. In some states farmers\u2019 markets offer a great variety of fresh vegetables and fruit from the region. \u201cThere are also dairy products, bread and meat without chemical additives at these markets. Organic food is not only much healthier but it tastes a lot better as well,\u201d explains Emma from Boston. So how about some healthy recipes for Thanksgiving? Maybe pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes? A roast turkey breast or a turkey roulade filled with apples and cranberries is delicious too. But there\u2019s more to a healthy lifestyle than just food. A lot of trend sports show that you can have fun, spend time with friends and stay fit at the same time. Have you found the right sport for you yet? If not, here is a suggestion: How about standup paddleboarding? If you like water, that\u2019s the ideal kind of sport for you. You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: \u201cDrinking too much alcohol isn\u2019t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?\u201d Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don\u2019t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion"}

Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy \u2013 after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world\u2019s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren\u2019t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is \u2018fracking\u2019, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, \u201cFracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.\u201d But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada\u2019s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the end of this yet,\u201d says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. \u201cCO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.\u201d 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven\u2019t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won\u2019t change. \u201cWhat worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.\u201d Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable \u2013 which means that when we have used them up, there simply won\u2019t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada\u2019s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better \u2013 and we will have to.   The sound of ice I\u2019m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn\u2019t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship\u2019s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the \u2018northwest passage\u2019, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn\u2019t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship\u2019s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It\u2019s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn\u2019t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we\u2019d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn\u2019t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn\u2019t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back\u2019s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can\u2019t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let\u2019s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I\u2019m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown.

I thought it was a magical city with a very special atmosphere. It\u2019s small enough to get around easily and not feel lost, but big enough that there\u2019s a lot to do. So after I left school, I decided to go to university there. It was a good decision \u2013 I had a wonderful time! The locals were really friendly and after some time I even started to understand the Edinburgh accent. In fact, I loved Edinburgh so much that I stayed after university. At first I lived and worked in the city, but after I met my husband (who is a true Scotsman!) we moved to the countryside nearby. I work from home now as I have my own business. But I love to drive to the city at the weekend in my Mini. Last week my parents came to stay and we visited Edinburgh Castle and the Scottish National Gallery. One day we took the children to the zoo, and another day we took a boat out to Inchcolm Abbey on a nearby island. Most days we had a picnic lunch in the Princes Street Gardens.I love that there are so many different things to do in Edinburgh. This city really has become my home now. I couldn\u2019t imagine moving away! Answer the question in a full sentence: Why did Caroline move to Edinburgh? (\"She moved to Edinburgh to study and because she loved the city.\u201d)"}

Describe the narrator in about 120 words.    We can do even better \u2013 by Lindsay Fern (21\/1\/2017) 1. Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy \u2013 after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world\u2019s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren\u2019t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is \u2018fracking\u2019, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, \u201cFracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.\u201d But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada\u2019s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the end of this yet,\u201d says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. \u201cCO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.\u201d 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven\u2019t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won\u2019t change. \u201cWhat worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.\u201d Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable \u2013 which means that when we have used them up, there simply won\u2019t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada\u2019s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better \u2013 and we will have to.   The sound of ice I\u2019m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn\u2019t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship\u2019s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the \u2018northwest passage\u2019, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn\u2019t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship\u2019s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It\u2019s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn\u2019t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we\u2019d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn\u2019t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn\u2019t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back\u2019s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can\u2019t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let\u2019s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I\u2019m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown. Stephen Samuel Stanley \u2013 ship\u2019s doctor, HMS Erebus"}

I thought it was a magical city with a very special atmosphere. It\u2019s small enough to get around easily and not feel lost, but big enough that there\u2019s a lot to do. So after I left school, I decided to go to university there. It was a good decision \u2013 I had a wonderful time! The locals were really friendly and after some time I even started to understand the Edinburgh accent. In fact, I loved Edinburgh so much that I stayed after university. At first I lived and worked in the city, but after I met my husband (who is a true Scotsman!) we moved to the countryside nearby. I work from home now as I have my own business. But I love to drive to the city at the weekend in my Mini. Last week my parents came to stay and we visited Edinburgh Castle and the Scottish National Gallery. One day we took the children to the zoo, and another day we took a boat out to Inchcolm Abbey on a nearby island. Most days we had a picnic lunch in the Princes Street Gardens.I love that there are so many different things to do in Edinburgh. This city really has become my home now. I couldn\u2019t imagine moving away! Answer the question in a full sentence: Why did Caroline move to Edinburgh? (\"She moved to Edinburgh to study and because she loved the city.\u201d)"}

They decide to go on a trip to find the boy\u2019s body and prepare for the trip. The Gun My room was on the second floor, and it was really hot up there. I was glad I wasn\u2019t sleeping there that night, and the thought of where we were going made me excited again. I rolled up two blankets and tied an old belt around them. I grabbed all my money, which was less than a dollar. Then I was ready to go. I went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad. I was walking up Carbine Street towards the clubhouse when Chris caught up with me. His eyes were shining. \u201cGordie! You want to see something?\u201d \u201cSure. What?\u201d \u201cCome down here first.\u201d He pointed down an alley between two shops. \u201cWhat is it, Chris?\u201d \u201cCome on, I said!\u201d He ran down the alley and I ran after him. At the bottom, the smell from the trash was terrible. \u201cChris, I\u2019m going to puke, I\u2019m \u2013 \u201d But I forgot about the smell when Chris put his hand into his backpack and pulled out a big gun. \u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d \u201cFrom my dad\u2019s desk.\u201d \u201cMan, your dad\u2019s going to beat you when he finds out.\u201d Chris\u2019s eyes just went on dancing. \u201cHe isn\u2019t going to find out.

He was the only one of us who didn\u2019t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they\u2019d stolen from their father. \u201cHave you got bullets for it?\u201d \u201cNine of them \u2013 all that was left in the box.

I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA \u2013 BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin \u2013 it was the work of an evil magician. \u201cWow!\u201d I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn\u2019t tell if he was amused or scared. \u201cYou did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!\u201d \u201cShut up! Let\u2019s go!\u201d I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. \u201cMan, it\u2019s a pity you couldn\u2019t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.\u201d \u201cYou knew there was a bullet in it, didn\u2019t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad\u2019s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.\u201d Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again.

Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? headline written by Pam Warner (published 07\/12\/16 in Health & Style ) author, date, source What is your Thanksgiving like? Turkey and pumpkin pie? American football on the sofa? In the last couple of years a new trend has become popular in the USA: More people like to eat better quality food and live a more active life. introduction It is slowly going out of fashion to live off convenience and frozen food. A number of people shop for organic food at special supermarkets instead. In some states farmers\u2019 markets offer a great variety of fresh vegetables and fruit from the region. \u201cThere are also dairy products, bread and meat without chemical additives at these markets. Organic food is not only much healthier but it tastes a lot better as well,\u201d explains Emma from Boston. So how about some healthy recipes for Thanksgiving? Maybe pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes? A roast turkey breast or a turkey roulade filled with apples and cranberries is delicious too. But there\u2019s more to a healthy lifestyle than just food. A lot of trend sports show that you can have fun, spend time with friends and stay fit at the same time. Have you found the right sport for you yet? If not, here is a suggestion: How about standup paddleboarding? If you like water, that\u2019s the ideal kind of sport for you. You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: \u201cDrinking too much alcohol isn\u2019t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?\u201d Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don\u2019t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion"}

You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: \u201cDrinking too much alcohol isn\u2019t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?\u201d Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don\u2019t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion   A first date Dylan often thought about Abby.

It grins or sneers to show it is excited or afraid. It presses its lips together if it wants to impress another chimp. When it plays, a chimp generally has an open smile with its top teeth covered. Apart from its face, a chimp also uses body language to communicate. For example, its hair stands on end when it is excited. That reaction can also mean that it is afraid. When it is aggressive, it usually raises its arms or hits the ground and stares at another animal. A chimp normally produces more than 15 different types of call. For example, there is a special identification call that will help its family find it. When chimps play, they often make a sound similar to our laughter. Body contact is very important for preserving harmony in a group of chimpanzees. That is why chimpanzees often groom each other for hours. It helps them stay calm and creates feelings of friendship. What is the most interesting fact in the text, in your opinion?"}

Find more information about the product here: digione.ch Why I love Edinburgh I first visited Edinburgh as a child with my parents and my sister. I thought it was a magical city with a very special atmosphere. It\u2019s small enough to get around easily and not feel lost, but big enough that there\u2019s a lot to do. So after I left school, I decided to go to university there. It was a good decision \u2013 I had a wonderful time! The locals were really friendly and after some time I even started to understand the Edinburgh accent. In fact, I loved Edinburgh so much that I stayed after university. At first I lived and worked in the city, but after I met my husband (who is a true Scotsman!) we moved to the countryside nearby. I work from home now as I have my own business. But I love to drive to the city at the weekend in my Mini. Last week my parents came to stay and we visited Edinburgh Castle and the Scottish National Gallery. One day we took the children to the zoo, and another day we took a boat out to Inchcolm Abbey on a nearby island. Most days we had a picnic lunch in the Princes Street Gardens.I love that there are so many different things to do in Edinburgh. This city really has become my home now.

Luke and Gwen were on the bus. \u201cDad said we can get a takeaway pizza tonight,\u201d said Gwen. \u201cI love tuna pizza. What\u2019s your favourite pizza, Luke?\u201d Luke didn\u2019t answer. \u201cDid you hear me?\u201d asked Gwen. \u201cSorry.

I forgot you have a problem with your eyes,\u201d said Luke. \u201cYou forgot Dave\u2019s birthday. You forgot your homework. You forget everything,\u201d said Gwen. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d said Luke. He looked out of the window. \u201cOh no! This is my stop. I forgot where we are! Bye Gwen, see you tomorrow.\u201d Luke rushed down the stairs and got off the bus. He wanted to finish his game. He put his hand in his pocket, but his phone wasn\u2019t there! \u201cOh no, I must have forgotten it on the bus!\u201d He looked up. But the bus wasn\u2019t there any more. Luke went home and phoned the bus company. They wanted to help but first they needed a special number from his phone \u2013 and he didn\u2019t know the number! Luke didn\u2019t enjoy his dinner at all that night. Why wasn\u2019t he more careful with his phone? Suddenly the doorbell rang. \u201cGwen\u2019s here!\u201d shouted Luke\u2019s mum from the hall. Luke went to the door. Gwen and her dad were there. \u201cI heard something fall on the floor when you got off the bus,\u201d said Gwen. \u201cI asked a woman to see what it was.\u201d Gwen gave Luke his phone. \u201cWow!\u201d said Luke. \u201cToday is my lucky day! Thanks, Gwen.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what friends are for!\u201d said Gwen. \u201cCome on, Gwen. Let\u2019s get that pizza!\u201d said Gwen\u2019s dad. Luke put his phone in his pocket.

I want to be with my friends. But I\u2019m not. Mum and Dad sent me to stay with Aunt Susan for six long days. To a village! In the middle of nowhere. All you can see are fields, trees and some animals. There are no shops, no caf\u00e9s and no buses. No skate park either! It\u2019s so boring! How can people live here? There was a party in the village this evening. But it wasn\u2019t fun. There was a barbecue 1 and then singing and dancing. But the music was awful. I was so bored that I turned their music off and played some hip-hop 2 instead. Everybody was mad and shouted at me. I laughed at them and left. I hate this place and I hate these people. How can birds be so loud? Some of them started singing at four in the morning! Later the church bells 3 rang 4 . Nothing happened today. Just another boring day. When can I go home? Nothing! Aunt Susan wanted me to help with the cows and in the garden, but I stayed in my room and watched films. The village boys tried to pick me up for a football game. I told them that I didn\u2019t have my football shoes and couldn\u2019t play. I can\u2019t believe what happened last night. I woke up in the middle of the night because there was a loud noise in the house. I went to the kitchen and saw Aunt Susan there. She was on the phone, and she was very excited. When she saw me, she told me to come with her. Rosalie needed help. I didn\u2019t know who Rosalie was. I was surprised when I saw that Rosalie was one of Aunt Susan\u2019s cows. She needed help with her calf. Some other people from the village were there too. They were all very calm and knew what to do. They told me to hold the light so that the vet could see well. I could hardly look. That noise! And it smelt terrible. Yuck! 5 Then it was there. A little calf. So sweet, so clumsy. We all felt very happy. I was so tired but so excited. I got up early again. I just had to see if the calf was OK. It was. It stood next to Rosalie and drank its milk. It\u2019s the most beautiful little cow I\u2019ve ever seen 6 .

Any questions?\u201d \u201cWhat about lunch?\u201d asked Alejandro. \u201cThere\u2019s a packed lunch with sandwiches, fruit and a cake,\u201d answered Robert. \u201cDo I need my GPS 1 map?\u201d asked Maria. \u201cIt\u2019s the New Forest, not the Amazon jungle 2 !\u201d said Shruti. \u201cI\u2019ve got a map, but you can take yours too,\u201d said Robert. Maria smiled. 12:34 p.m.: In the forest \u201cWhen is lunch?\u201d asked Shruti. \u201cWe\u2019re going to stop at the picnic spot 3 ,\u201d said Robert. \u201cHow far is that?\u201d asked Shruti. \u201cIt\u2019s on my map,\u201d said Robert. He looked in his bag as 4 he walked. Suddenly Robert tripped. He fell down a bank and into a small river. His bag opened, and all the sandwiches went into the river. The students ran down to him. \u201cAre you OK?\u201d asked Alejandro. \u201cIt\u2019s my ankle,\u201d said Robert. \u201cI think it\u2019s broken.\u201d Maria and Daniel pulled Robert out of the river. Alejandro held his leg as they moved him. Then Shruti took out her phone. \u201cWhat are we going to do? We don\u2019t know where we are, and there\u2019s no signal!\u201d she said. \u201cI know first aid 5 . I can look after Robert until we get help,\u201d said Alejandro. \u201cAnd I can use my GPS to find out where we are,\u201d said Maria. Alejandro looked at Robert\u2019s ankle and Daniel gave him some water. Shruti didn\u2019t know what to do. She felt bad. \u201cCome here, Shruti. You can help me,\u201d said Maria. \u201cWe need someone to run and get help, and you can run fast.\u201d \u201cWhere should I go?\u201d Shruti asked excitedly. \u201cLook at my GPS,\u201d said Maria. \u201cThere\u2019s a hill about two miles from here. You can get a signal at the top of it. Run there and call the emergency services.\u201d \u201cGood luck, Shruti!\u201d said Alejandro as Shruti started to run. 2:00 p.m.: In the forest \u201cWhere\u2019s Shruti? I hope she\u2019s OK,\u201d said Alejandro. \u201cRobert needs help soon.\u201d Robert was in a lot of pain 6 . Suddenly they heard a noise. \u201cIt\u2019s a helicopter!\u201d said Maria. The helicopter landed and soon Shruti arrived with two paramedics. \u201cWell done, Shruti!\u201d said Alejandro. \u201cThank you. And thank you, Maria, for knowing where to go,\u201d Shruti said. The paramedics gave Robert a warm blanket, a drink and a tablet. \u201cWell done, everyone!\u201d said Robert. \u201cYou\u2019ve shown what you can do when you work together.

Find more information about the product here: digione.ch Why I love Edinburgh I first visited Edinburgh as a child with my parents and my sister. I thought it was a magical city with a very special atmosphere. It\u2019s small enough to get around easily and not feel lost, but big enough that there\u2019s a lot to do. So after I left school, I decided to go to university there. It was a good decision \u2013 I had a wonderful time! The locals were really friendly and after some time I even started to understand the Edinburgh accent. In fact, I loved Edinburgh so much that I stayed after university. At first I lived and worked in the city, but after I met my husband (who is a true Scotsman!) we moved to the countryside nearby. I work from home now as I have my own business. But I love to drive to the city at the weekend in my Mini. Last week my parents came to stay and we visited Edinburgh Castle and the Scottish National Gallery. One day we took the children to the zoo, and another day we took a boat out to Inchcolm Abbey on a nearby island. Most days we had a picnic lunch in the Princes Street Gardens.I love that there are so many different things to do in Edinburgh. This city really has become my home now. I couldn\u2019t imagine moving away! Answer the question in a full sentence: Why did Caroline move to Edinburgh? (\"She moved to Edinburgh to study and because she loved the city.\u201d)"}

We can do even better \u2013 by Lindsay Fern (21\/1\/2017) 1. Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy \u2013 after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world\u2019s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren\u2019t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is \u2018fracking\u2019, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, \u201cFracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.\u201d But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada\u2019s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the end of this yet,\u201d says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. \u201cCO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.\u201d 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven\u2019t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won\u2019t change. \u201cWhat worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.\u201d Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable \u2013 which means that when we have used them up, there simply won\u2019t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada\u2019s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better \u2013 and we will have to.   The sound of ice I\u2019m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn\u2019t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship\u2019s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the \u2018northwest passage\u2019, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn\u2019t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship\u2019s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It\u2019s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn\u2019t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we\u2019d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn\u2019t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn\u2019t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back\u2019s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can\u2019t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let\u2019s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I\u2019m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown. Stephen Samuel Stanley \u2013 ship\u2019s doctor, HMS Erebus"}

Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn\u2019t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship\u2019s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the \u2018northwest passage\u2019, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn\u2019t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship\u2019s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It\u2019s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn\u2019t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we\u2019d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn\u2019t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn\u2019t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back\u2019s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can\u2019t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let\u2019s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I\u2019m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown. Stephen Samuel Stanley \u2013 ship\u2019s doctor, HMS Erebus   In New Zealand   Working in India Get to know India and work as a volunteer Teaching young children in an orphanage in Jaipur Building and repairing schools in Goa Helping stray dogs in Ranchi For more information contact Mrs Lal. (a.lal@vii.com) My name is Emma De Santis. I\u2019m from Germany and I\u2019m 18 years old. I took part in a project at an orphanage in Jaipur last year. My English isn\u2019t bad and I used to work as a babysitter for our neighbours\u2019 kids. I could choose to work from four weeks to ten months. I decided to stay for eight weeks. Before I went to India, I had to get all the important papers. I also knew that I would have to pay the organization almost \u20ac2,000. The flight was not included. So I decided to work in a supermarket to earn the money. When I got the contract for the project in India, I booked my flight and I was ready to go. When I arrived in Jaipur, I was very tired from the journey and the time difference. The heat, the noise and the smells made it even worse. But I still remember a cow lying in front of the phone shop. During the orientation days I met other volunteers from different countries, which was great. After that I met my host family. They were very friendly people. However, I was homesick during the first days, and I had some problems with the food. It was so spicy. At the time I thought, \u201cIf I don\u2019t feel better soon, I\u2019ll have to quit.\u201d But I got over it quickly. My job was great but challenging too. The working conditions were OK. I was teaching 10-year-old girls English and organizing some free-time activities for the younger ones. The staff were very helpful. They all spoke English, which made things a little easier. I quickly found out that things are different in India. Most people\u2019s attitude in India is \u201cWhatever happens, happens.\u201d And usually that\u2019s OK for everyone. Wherever I went, people were smiling at me. But they didn\u2019t just show interest in me, many of them actually stared at me. But you learn to ignore it. I can really recommend taking part in a project like this. I met wonderful people, made new friends and learned a lot about myself. If you go to India, you\u2019ll never forget it."}

I want to be with my friends. But I\u2019m not. Mum and Dad sent me to stay with Aunt Susan for six long days. To a village! In the middle of nowhere.

There was a party in the village this evening. But it wasn\u2019t fun. There was a barbecue 1 and then singing and dancing. But the music was awful. I was so bored that I turned their music off and played some hip-hop 2 instead. Everybody was mad and shouted at me. I laughed at them and left. I hate this place and I hate these people.

I woke up in the middle of the night because there was a loud noise in the house. I went to the kitchen and saw Aunt Susan there. She was on the phone, and she was very excited.

We can do even better \u2013 by Lindsay Fern (21\/1\/2017) 1. Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy \u2013 after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world\u2019s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren\u2019t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is \u2018fracking\u2019, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, \u201cFracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.\u201d But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada\u2019s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the end of this yet,\u201d says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. \u201cCO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.\u201d 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven\u2019t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won\u2019t change. \u201cWhat worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.\u201d Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable \u2013 which means that when we have used them up, there simply won\u2019t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada\u2019s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better \u2013 and we will have to."}

The Titanic disaster The Belfast News Wednesday, 17th April 1912 TWO DAYS AFTER \u2013 MORE FACTS The giant ship Titanic, which was built here in Belfast\u2019s shipyard, hit an iceberg on 14th April, shortly before midnight. Water filled the ship until it sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD\u2019S LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship\u2019s builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. LOCAL MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland. The ship\u2019s doctor, Dr John Simpson, 37, was born in Belfast. His mother was optimistic when a letter from him arrived at her home yesterday. However, we have found out that he posted the letter during the ship\u2019s last stop. We now know that Dr Simpson did not survive. DOG SAVES LIVES Some were lucky and the ships which came to save the passengers of the Titanic found their lifeboat. According to a passenger, one of the dogs on board saved the lives of the people in one lifeboat. A ship only found this lifeboat in the dark night and the foggy weather because they heard the dog when it barked. HOW COULD IT HAPPEN? After the sinking of the Titanic a number of questions still need answers. Why did no one see the iceberg? Why did the ship break? Why were there only 20 lifeboats for 2,200 people on board? Why did lifeboats leave the ship when they were not yet full? And how can we make sure that an accident like this will never happen again? About 700 people survived the accident. Some ships today have over 6,500 passengers and crew. After the Titanic\u2019s accident there were laws that ships must have one lifeboat place for every person on board. Dr Simpson\u2019s last letter to his mother is now in the Belfast Titanic museum.   A deadly silence 1. My name is Jonas Fox and I\u2019m twelve years old. I work in the mines and my job is to sit near a door in the tunnel every day. I must open the door when the coal arrives. Then, after it\u2019s gone, I quickly close the door again. Every day I sit in the dark, but I\u2019m never scared. That\u2019s because my friend Billy is always there with me. Billy sings all day long. He\u2019s yellow with little black eyes which look like they are made of glass. Billy is a canary, you see? It\u2019s never boring with Billy around. I would love to sing too, but I can\u2019t even talk. 2. Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine killed 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there\u2019s gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine. One day Bart started to cough and he never stopped coughing after that. Then one night my brother coughed so badly that he died. That was when I stopped talking. I don\u2019t know why, really. I still had words in my head and I opened my mouth, but I couldn\u2019t speak. The men in the mine started to call me \u2018Silent Jonas\u2019 after that. They probably thought I was a bit strange. 4. The day when things got really bad started like any other. Billy was singing like he always did. I heard the people in the tunnels and the noise of the coal trucks. I opened the door and I felt a cold wind in the tunnel. I closed the door again. Billy stopped singing. For a moment I didn\u2019t understand. But then, suddenly, I did: There was gas in the mine! And it could explode any second. I didn\u2019t have time to run down the tunnel to warn the men. If only I could talk, if only I could shout! 5. I knew I had to warn everyone in the mine. So I opened my mouth and tried to say it: \u201cGas.\u201d But there was no sound. Nothing came out. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth again. Nothing. I panicked. We could die in here \u2013 I had to speak! I tried again. This time the sound was quiet, but I made a sound. At last! I opened the door and shouted, \u201cGas. Gas. GAS!\u201d A moment later I heard the sound of the miners\u2019 boots in the tunnels. I took Billy\u2019s cage and ran too. 6. I ran through the tunnel as fast as I could. But my head hurt and I couldn\u2019t breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn\u2019t tell where it was coming from. \u201cCome on, boy!\u201d it said. Somebody picked me up. I turned around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy\u2019s cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn\u2019t just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, \u201cWho warned us?\u201d \u201cMe!\u201d I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. \u201cSilent Jonas found his voice!\u201d a miner shouted. But how could I feel happy? My friend Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small \u2018Tweet\u2019. Billy was alive! I opened the cage \u2026 There were canaries in mines until 1987. Today miners use machines to find out if there is gas in the mine.   The Norman conquest The old king of England, Edward, died in 1066. He had no children and both his Anglo-Saxon brother-in-law, Harold, and his French cousin, William, Duke of Normandy, wanted to be the next king of England. Harold made himself king, and William was very angry. So what did he do next? He sailed to England with his army \u2026 Harold and William fought the battle on Senlac Hill, near Hastings. William\u2019s men were knights and they were better trained. They fought on horses and were good archers. Harold\u2019s men fought on foot and they were already tired from an earlier battle at Stamford Bridge, 200 miles away in the north of England. (Yes, they had to walk those 200 miles!) How do we know what happened during the Battle of Hastings? Well, we have the 70-metre long Bayeux Tapestry to tell us! The tapestry is like a comic and it tells the story of the battle. It tells us that Harold died when he got an arrow in his eye, but we don\u2019t know if this really happened. William won the Battle of Hastings and he became king of England on Christmas Day 1066. Today we know him as William the Conqueror. He was a big castle fan and built lots of them in England, including part of the Tower of London. He also took land from the Anglo-Saxons and gave it to his Norman friends. Did the Normans change England? Yes, of course they did! For example, they brought many new words to the English language. Words like \u2018pork\u2019 and \u2018garden\u2019 come from this time. Guess what? There are still many English people who have Norman surnames, like Archer or Darcy. Before the Normans came to England, most people didn\u2019t even have surnames. They lived in small villages, so a first name or a nickname was often enough. ___ conquest \u2013 Eroberung ; the Anglo-Saxons \u2013 die Angelsachsen (das Volk, das schon vor 1066 in England lebte) ; brother-in-law \u2013 Schwager ; duke \u2013 Herzog ; army \u2013 Heer; Armee ; knight \u2013 Ritter ; archer \u2013 Bogensch\u00fctze; Bogensch\u00fctzin ; tapestry \u2013 Wandteppich ; surname \u2013 Nachname; Familienname   The RNLI: Volunteers on the coast The RNLI is the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. It\u2019s a charity and it saves lives at sea. The RNLI has 237 lifeboat stations and about 4,600 crew members in the UK and Ireland. The RNLI rescues about 8,000 people per year. The RNLI has saved about 140,000 lives since 1824. Many of the lifeboat crew members are volunteers. The RNLI gets money from fundraising. 18th June 2016, by Simon Spade Yesterday the RNLI rescued two teenage boys who got into trouble when they were kayaking off the coast near Llandudno. The two 14-year-old boys went out too far in their kayaks and could not get back to the beach because of strong winds. They tried to get back for more than two and a half hours, then shouted for help and waved. A tourist spotted the boys and made an emergency call to the RNLI. The lifeboat crew left their station at 1:40 p.m. and got to the kayaks in only a few minutes. The RNLI crew picked up the boys and gave them blankets and hot drinks to keep them warm. Lifeboat helm Howard Link called the ambulance to meet them on the beach. Both boys were very weak and seasick. They both spent the night in Llandudno hospital but are back home now. The lifeboat crew got back to their station at 3:25 p.m. There are some rules to remember when you go to the beach: S pot the dangers. A lways go with a friend or adult. F ind and follow the safety signs and flags. E mergency \u2013 put up your hand and shout or call 999\/112. Most lifeboat crew members are volunteers. Let\u2019s meet some.

Name: Susan Merchant Job: Teacher Lifeboat crew member: I grew up in Wales near the sea, so I have been in boats for many years. I help during the rescue and look after the rescued person. Name: John Taylor Job: Student Lifeboat youth volunteer: I\u2019m only 16 so I\u2019m too young to join the lifeboat crew, but I work at the station.

It grins or sneers to show it is excited or afraid. It presses its lips together if it wants to impress another chimp. When it plays, a chimp generally has an open smile with its top teeth covered. Apart from its face, a chimp also uses body language to communicate. For example, its hair stands on end when it is excited. That reaction can also mean that it is afraid. When it is aggressive, it usually raises its arms or hits the ground and stares at another animal. A chimp normally produces more than 15 different types of call. For example, there is a special identification call that will help its family find it. When chimps play, they often make a sound similar to our laughter. Body contact is very important for preserving harmony in a group of chimpanzees. That is why chimpanzees often groom each other for hours. It helps them stay calm and creates feelings of friendship.

I thought it was a magical city with a very special atmosphere. It\u2019s small enough to get around easily and not feel lost, but big enough that there\u2019s a lot to do. So after I left school, I decided to go to university there. It was a good decision \u2013 I had a wonderful time! The locals were really friendly and after some time I even started to understand the Edinburgh accent. In fact, I loved Edinburgh so much that I stayed after university. At first I lived and worked in the city, but after I met my husband (who is a true Scotsman!) we moved to the countryside nearby. I work from home now as I have my own business. But I love to drive to the city at the weekend in my Mini. Last week my parents came to stay and we visited Edinburgh Castle and the Scottish National Gallery. One day we took the children to the zoo, and another day we took a boat out to Inchcolm Abbey on a nearby island. Most days we had a picnic lunch in the Princes Street Gardens.I love that there are so many different things to do in Edinburgh. This city really has become my home now.

They decide to go on a trip to find the boy\u2019s body and prepare for the trip. The Gun My room was on the second floor, and it was really hot up there. I was glad I wasn\u2019t sleeping there that night, and the thought of where we were going made me excited again. I rolled up two blankets and tied an old belt around them. I grabbed all my money, which was less than a dollar. Then I was ready to go. I went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad. I was walking up Carbine Street towards the clubhouse when Chris caught up with me. His eyes were shining. \u201cGordie! You want to see something?\u201d \u201cSure. What?\u201d \u201cCome down here first.\u201d He pointed down an alley between two shops. \u201cWhat is it, Chris?\u201d \u201cCome on, I said!\u201d He ran down the alley and I ran after him. At the bottom, the smell from the trash was terrible. \u201cChris, I\u2019m going to puke, I\u2019m \u2013 \u201d But I forgot about the smell when Chris put his hand into his backpack and pulled out a big gun. \u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d \u201cFrom my dad\u2019s desk.\u201d \u201cMan, your dad\u2019s going to beat you when he finds out.\u201d Chris\u2019s eyes just went on dancing. \u201cHe isn\u2019t going to find out. He and his friends have got enough wine to keep them drunk for a week. I\u2019ll put it back before then.\u201d Chris hated alcohol \u2013 he\u2019d already seen too much of what it can do. He was the only one of us who didn\u2019t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they\u2019d stolen from their father. \u201cHave you got bullets for it?\u201d \u201cNine of them \u2013 all that was left in the box. He\u2019ll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.\u201d \u201cAny in it at the moment?\u201d \u201cNo, of course not. What do you think I am?\u201d I finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA \u2013 BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin \u2013 it was the work of an evil magician. \u201cWow!\u201d I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn\u2019t tell if he was amused or scared. \u201cYou did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!\u201d \u201cShut up! Let\u2019s go!\u201d I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. \u201cMan, it\u2019s a pity you couldn\u2019t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.\u201d \u201cYou knew there was a bullet in it, didn\u2019t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad\u2019s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.\u201d Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, \u201cWhat do you think we need a gun for?\u201d \u201cNothing, really,\u201d Chris said. \u201cExcept we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it\u2019s frightening out in the forest at night.\u201d Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?\u201d Teddy asked Vern. \u201cYeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it\u2019ll look as if we\u2019re there after dark.\u201d \u201cHey, man, great!\u201d I said, and slapped Vern on the back. For him, that was real thinking. He grinned. \u201cSo let\u2019s go,\u201d Teddy said. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly twelve already.\u201d Chris stood up and we gathered round him. \u201cWe\u2019ll walk across Beeman\u2019s field,\u201d he said, \u201cand then we\u2019ll get to the railway tracks and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.\u201d \u201cHow far is it, do you think?\u201d Teddy asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Chris. \u201cHarlow\u2019s big. We\u2019re going to have to walk at least twenty miles. Does that sound right to you, Gordie?\u201d \u201cYeah. Maybe more \u2013 thirty miles.\u201d \u201cCome on, you guys,\u201d Chris said, and picked up his backpack, blankets and water bottle.   Healthy and active at Thanksgiving?

In the last couple of years a new trend has become popular in the USA: More people like to eat better quality food and live a more active life. introduction It is slowly going out of fashion to live off convenience and frozen food. A number of people shop for organic food at special supermarkets instead. In some states farmers\u2019 markets offer a great variety of fresh vegetables and fruit from the region. \u201cThere are also dairy products, bread and meat without chemical additives at these markets. Organic food is not only much healthier but it tastes a lot better as well,\u201d explains Emma from Boston. So how about some healthy recipes for Thanksgiving? Maybe pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes? A roast turkey breast or a turkey roulade filled with apples and cranberries is delicious too. But there\u2019s more to a healthy lifestyle than just food. A lot of trend sports show that you can have fun, spend time with friends and stay fit at the same time. Have you found the right sport for you yet? If not, here is a suggestion: How about standup paddleboarding? If you like water, that\u2019s the ideal kind of sport for you. You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: \u201cDrinking too much alcohol isn\u2019t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?\u201d Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don\u2019t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion   A first date Dylan often thought about Abby. He really liked her. But he was too shy to ask her out on a date. Dylan\u2019s friend Forget her. She\u2019s not interested in you. She has a boyfriend.

Dylan helped Abby with her Science project. They didn\u2019t notice Scott and his football friends. Scott\u2019s friend Isn\u2019t she your girlfriend? Dylan Let me explain. It\u2019s not that hard! When Dylan went to the gym, the boys attacked him. Scott pushed him really hard and Dylan couldn\u2019t do anything about it. Scott Stay away from her! Abby Stop it! You\u2019re hurting him!

They decide to go on a trip to find the boy\u2019s body and prepare for the trip. The Gun My room was on the second floor, and it was really hot up there. I was glad I wasn\u2019t sleeping there that night, and the thought of where we were going made me excited again. I rolled up two blankets and tied an old belt around them. I grabbed all my money, which was less than a dollar. Then I was ready to go. I went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad. I was walking up Carbine Street towards the clubhouse when Chris caught up with me. His eyes were shining. \u201cGordie! You want to see something?\u201d \u201cSure. What?\u201d \u201cCome down here first.\u201d He pointed down an alley between two shops. \u201cWhat is it, Chris?\u201d \u201cCome on, I said!\u201d He ran down the alley and I ran after him. At the bottom, the smell from the trash was terrible. \u201cChris, I\u2019m going to puke, I\u2019m \u2013 \u201d But I forgot about the smell when Chris put his hand into his backpack and pulled out a big gun. \u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d \u201cFrom my dad\u2019s desk.\u201d \u201cMan, your dad\u2019s going to beat you when he finds out.\u201d Chris\u2019s eyes just went on dancing. \u201cHe isn\u2019t going to find out. He and his friends have got enough wine to keep them drunk for a week. I\u2019ll put it back before then.\u201d Chris hated alcohol \u2013 he\u2019d already seen too much of what it can do. He was the only one of us who didn\u2019t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they\u2019d stolen from their father. \u201cHave you got bullets for it?\u201d \u201cNine of them \u2013 all that was left in the box. He\u2019ll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.\u201d \u201cAny in it at the moment?\u201d \u201cNo, of course not. What do you think I am?\u201d I finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA \u2013 BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin \u2013 it was the work of an evil magician. \u201cWow!\u201d I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn\u2019t tell if he was amused or scared. \u201cYou did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!\u201d \u201cShut up! Let\u2019s go!\u201d I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. \u201cMan, it\u2019s a pity you couldn\u2019t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.\u201d \u201cYou knew there was a bullet in it, didn\u2019t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad\u2019s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.\u201d Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, \u201cWhat do you think we need a gun for?\u201d \u201cNothing, really,\u201d Chris said. \u201cExcept we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it\u2019s frightening out in the forest at night.\u201d Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?\u201d Teddy asked Vern. \u201cYeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it\u2019ll look as if we\u2019re there after dark.\u201d \u201cHey, man, great!\u201d I said, and slapped Vern on the back. For him, that was real thinking. He grinned. \u201cSo let\u2019s go,\u201d Teddy said. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly twelve already.\u201d Chris stood up and we gathered round him. \u201cWe\u2019ll walk across Beeman\u2019s field,\u201d he said, \u201cand then we\u2019ll get to the railway tracks and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.\u201d \u201cHow far is it, do you think?\u201d Teddy asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Chris. \u201cHarlow\u2019s big. We\u2019re going to have to walk at least twenty miles. Does that sound right to you, Gordie?\u201d \u201cYeah. Maybe more \u2013 thirty miles.\u201d \u201cCome on, you guys,\u201d Chris said, and picked up his backpack, blankets and water bottle.   Healthy and active at Thanksgiving?

How do you feel? What was it like on the lifeboat?    The Titanic disaster The Belfast News Wednesday, 17th April 1912 TWO DAYS AFTER \u2013 MORE FACTS The giant ship Titanic, which was built here in Belfast\u2019s shipyard, hit an iceberg on 14th April, shortly before midnight. Water filled the ship until it sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD\u2019S LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship\u2019s builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. LOCAL MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland. The ship\u2019s doctor, Dr John Simpson, 37, was born in Belfast. His mother was optimistic when a letter from him arrived at her home yesterday. However, we have found out that he posted the letter during the ship\u2019s last stop. We now know that Dr Simpson did not survive. DOG SAVES LIVES Some were lucky and the ships which came to save the passengers of the Titanic found their lifeboat. According to a passenger, one of the dogs on board saved the lives of the people in one lifeboat. A ship only found this lifeboat in the dark night and the foggy weather because they heard the dog when it barked. HOW COULD IT HAPPEN? After the sinking of the Titanic a number of questions still need answers. Why did no one see the iceberg? Why did the ship break? Why were there only 20 lifeboats for 2,200 people on board? Why did lifeboats leave the ship when they were not yet full? And how can we make sure that an accident like this will never happen again? About 700 people survived the accident. Some ships today have over 6,500 passengers and crew. After the Titanic\u2019s accident there were laws that ships must have one lifeboat place for every person on board.

Luke and Gwen were on the bus. \u201cDad said we can get a takeaway pizza tonight,\u201d said Gwen. \u201cI love tuna pizza. What\u2019s your favourite pizza, Luke?\u201d Luke didn\u2019t answer. \u201cDid you hear me?\u201d asked Gwen. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m playing this game on my phone,\u201d said Luke. \u201cI have a really high score. Look!\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t see that,\u201d said Gwen. \u201cSorry. I forgot you have a problem with your eyes,\u201d said Luke. \u201cYou forgot Dave\u2019s birthday. You forgot your homework. You forget everything,\u201d said Gwen. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d said Luke. He looked out of the window. \u201cOh no! This is my stop. I forgot where we are! Bye Gwen, see you tomorrow.\u201d Luke rushed down the stairs and got off the bus. He wanted to finish his game. He put his hand in his pocket, but his phone wasn\u2019t there! \u201cOh no, I must have forgotten it on the bus!\u201d He looked up. But the bus wasn\u2019t there any more. Luke went home and phoned the bus company. They wanted to help but first they needed a special number from his phone \u2013 and he didn\u2019t know the number! Luke didn\u2019t enjoy his dinner at all that night. Why wasn\u2019t he more careful with his phone? Suddenly the doorbell rang. \u201cGwen\u2019s here!\u201d shouted Luke\u2019s mum from the hall. Luke went to the door. Gwen and her dad were there. \u201cI heard something fall on the floor when you got off the bus,\u201d said Gwen. \u201cI asked a woman to see what it was.\u201d Gwen gave Luke his phone. \u201cWow!\u201d said Luke. \u201cToday is my lucky day! Thanks, Gwen.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what friends are for!\u201d said Gwen. \u201cCome on, Gwen. Let\u2019s get that pizza!\u201d said Gwen\u2019s dad. Luke put his phone in his pocket.

Ambition: to have my own restaurant   The amazing story of Dora White Narrator Dora White lives in the small village of Aldham, many miles from London. (A girl and an old woman are at a bus stop in the village. The girl has a bag. She has money in her hands.) Dora One, two, three, four pounds fifty. Yes! I have enough money for the bus to London. Old woman Why do young people always want to go to London? It\u2019s dirty and not safe. Dora That\u2019s not true. It\u2019s the most amazing city in the world. And it\u2019s the place where dreams come true 1 . London is the place for me! Old woman I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s an awful place. (Dora looks down the road. There is the sound of a bus.)

The lights go down 3 .) Narrator When Dora arrives in London, she gets a job. (Dora is in a busy restaurant kitchen. She is doing the washing up 4 . A chef and a waiter are in the kitchen. There are dirty plates, glasses and pots next to Dora.) Waiter I need six plates and glasses now! Dora One moment, please. Chef Work faster. I need three clean pots now. Dora Yes, chef. Chef Where are they? I need them now! Dora You can have them in a minute. I\u2019m busy with these plates. (Dora gives the plates to the waiter.) Waiter These plates are dirty! Dora I\u2019m sorry!

Narrator Dora\u2019s life in London isn\u2019t like it was in her dreams. (Dora is at a London bus stop with her bag. She looks very sad.) Dora Maybe London isn\u2019t the place for me. (Dora sees a leaflet on the road. She takes it and looks at it.) (She reads from the leaflet.) Three Lions Hotel. We need kitchen workers for our very special restaurant. We are a friendly restaurant, but you must be hard-working and determined. (Dora smiles and stands up straight. There is the sound of a bus.) Bus driver (From off the stage 6 , on the left) Do you want to get on? This is the last bus to Aldham today. Dora No thanks. I want to stay here. London is the place for me.

I want to be with my friends. But I\u2019m not. Mum and Dad sent me to stay with Aunt Susan for six long days. To a village! In the middle of nowhere. All you can see are fields, trees and some animals. There are no shops, no caf\u00e9s and no buses. No skate park either! It\u2019s so boring! How can people live here? There was a party in the village this evening. But it wasn\u2019t fun. There was a barbecue 1 and then singing and dancing. But the music was awful. I was so bored that I turned their music off and played some hip-hop 2 instead. Everybody was mad and shouted at me. I laughed at them and left. I hate this place and I hate these people. How can birds be so loud? Some of them started singing at four in the morning! Later the church bells 3 rang 4 . Nothing happened today. Just another boring day. When can I go home? Nothing! Aunt Susan wanted me to help with the cows and in the garden, but I stayed in my room and watched films. The village boys tried to pick me up for a football game. I told them that I didn\u2019t have my football shoes and couldn\u2019t play. I can\u2019t believe what happened last night. I woke up in the middle of the night because there was a loud noise in the house. I went to the kitchen and saw Aunt Susan there. She was on the phone, and she was very excited. When she saw me, she told me to come with her. Rosalie needed help. I didn\u2019t know who Rosalie was. I was surprised when I saw that Rosalie was one of Aunt Susan\u2019s cows. She needed help with her calf. Some other people from the village were there too. They were all very calm and knew what to do. They told me to hold the light so that the vet could see well. I could hardly look. That noise! And it smelt terrible. Yuck! 5 Then it was there. A little calf. So sweet, so clumsy. We all felt very happy. I was so tired but so excited. I got up early again. I just had to see if the calf was OK. It was. It stood next to Rosalie and drank its milk. It\u2019s the most beautiful little cow I\u2019ve ever seen 6 . I think I\u2019ll ask Aunt Susan if I can come back again.

I\u2019m Robert, the leader for today\u2019s walk. Can Shruti, Alejandro, Daniel and Maria come with me?\u201d Four students got up and followed Robert. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go hiking in the forest,\u201d said Robert. \u201cYou should all have long trousers, good shoes, a hat and a bottle of water. Any questions?\u201d \u201cWhat about lunch?\u201d asked Alejandro. \u201cThere\u2019s a packed lunch with sandwiches, fruit and a cake,\u201d answered Robert. \u201cDo I need my GPS 1 map?\u201d asked Maria. \u201cIt\u2019s the New Forest, not the Amazon jungle 2 !\u201d said Shruti. \u201cI\u2019ve got a map, but you can take yours too,\u201d said Robert. Maria smiled. 12:34 p.m.: In the forest \u201cWhen is lunch?\u201d asked Shruti. \u201cWe\u2019re going to stop at the picnic spot 3 ,\u201d said Robert. \u201cHow far is that?\u201d asked Shruti. \u201cIt\u2019s on my map,\u201d said Robert. He looked in his bag as 4 he walked. Suddenly Robert tripped. He fell down a bank and into a small river. His bag opened, and all the sandwiches went into the river. The students ran down to him. \u201cAre you OK?\u201d asked Alejandro. \u201cIt\u2019s my ankle,\u201d said Robert. \u201cI think it\u2019s broken.\u201d Maria and Daniel pulled Robert out of the river. Alejandro held his leg as they moved him. Then Shruti took out her phone. \u201cWhat are we going to do? We don\u2019t know where we are, and there\u2019s no signal!\u201d she said. \u201cI know first aid 5 . I can look after Robert until we get help,\u201d said Alejandro. \u201cAnd I can use my GPS to find out where we are,\u201d said Maria. Alejandro looked at Robert\u2019s ankle and Daniel gave him some water. Shruti didn\u2019t know what to do. She felt bad. \u201cCome here, Shruti. You can help me,\u201d said Maria. \u201cWe need someone to run and get help, and you can run fast.\u201d \u201cWhere should I go?\u201d Shruti asked excitedly. \u201cLook at my GPS,\u201d said Maria. \u201cThere\u2019s a hill about two miles from here. You can get a signal at the top of it. Run there and call the emergency services.\u201d \u201cGood luck, Shruti!\u201d said Alejandro as Shruti started to run. 2:00 p.m.: In the forest \u201cWhere\u2019s Shruti? I hope she\u2019s OK,\u201d said Alejandro. \u201cRobert needs help soon.\u201d Robert was in a lot of pain 6 . Suddenly they heard a noise. \u201cIt\u2019s a helicopter!\u201d said Maria. The helicopter landed and soon Shruti arrived with two paramedics. \u201cWell done, Shruti!\u201d said Alejandro. \u201cThank you. And thank you, Maria, for knowing where to go,\u201d Shruti said. The paramedics gave Robert a warm blanket, a drink and a tablet. \u201cWell done, everyone!\u201d said Robert. \u201cYou\u2019ve shown what you can do when you work together.

He was the only one of us who didn\u2019t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they\u2019d stolen from their father. \u201cHave you got bullets for it?\u201d \u201cNine of them \u2013 all that was left in the box. He\u2019ll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.\u201d \u201cAny in it at the moment?\u201d \u201cNo, of course not. What do you think I am?\u201d I finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA \u2013 BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin \u2013 it was the work of an evil magician. \u201cWow!\u201d I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn\u2019t tell if he was amused or scared. \u201cYou did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!\u201d \u201cShut up! Let\u2019s go!\u201d I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. \u201cMan, it\u2019s a pity you couldn\u2019t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.\u201d \u201cYou knew there was a bullet in it, didn\u2019t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad\u2019s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.\u201d Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, \u201cWhat do you think we need a gun for?\u201d \u201cNothing, really,\u201d Chris said. \u201cExcept we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it\u2019s frightening out in the forest at night.\u201d Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?\u201d Teddy asked Vern. \u201cYeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it\u2019ll look as if we\u2019re there after dark.\u201d \u201cHey, man, great!\u201d I said, and slapped Vern on the back. For him, that was real thinking. He grinned. \u201cSo let\u2019s go,\u201d Teddy said. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly twelve already.\u201d Chris stood up and we gathered round him. \u201cWe\u2019ll walk across Beeman\u2019s field,\u201d he said, \u201cand then we\u2019ll get to the railway tracks and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.\u201d \u201cHow far is it, do you think?\u201d Teddy asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Chris. \u201cHarlow\u2019s big. We\u2019re going to have to walk at least twenty miles. Does that sound right to you, Gordie?\u201d \u201cYeah. Maybe more \u2013 thirty miles.\u201d \u201cCome on, you guys,\u201d Chris said, and picked up his backpack, blankets and water bottle.   Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? headline written by Pam Warner (published 07\/12\/16 in Health & Style ) author, date, source What is your Thanksgiving like? Turkey and pumpkin pie? American football on the sofa? In the last couple of years a new trend has become popular in the USA: More people like to eat better quality food and live a more active life. introduction It is slowly going out of fashion to live off convenience and frozen food. A number of people shop for organic food at special supermarkets instead. In some states farmers\u2019 markets offer a great variety of fresh vegetables and fruit from the region. \u201cThere are also dairy products, bread and meat without chemical additives at these markets. Organic food is not only much healthier but it tastes a lot better as well,\u201d explains Emma from Boston. So how about some healthy recipes for Thanksgiving? Maybe pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes? A roast turkey breast or a turkey roulade filled with apples and cranberries is delicious too. But there\u2019s more to a healthy lifestyle than just food. A lot of trend sports show that you can have fun, spend time with friends and stay fit at the same time. Have you found the right sport for you yet? If not, here is a suggestion: How about standup paddleboarding? If you like water, that\u2019s the ideal kind of sport for you. You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: \u201cDrinking too much alcohol isn\u2019t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?\u201d Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don\u2019t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion   A first date Dylan often thought about Abby. He really liked her. But he was too shy to ask her out on a date. Dylan\u2019s friend Forget her. She\u2019s not interested in you. She has a boyfriend. One day his books fell out of his locker right when Abby showed up. With Scott in tow, of course. How embarrassing. Scott Who\u2019s that guy? Look at him! A few days later they had lunch together. Dylan helped Abby with her Science project. They didn\u2019t notice Scott and his football friends. Scott\u2019s friend Isn\u2019t she your girlfriend? Dylan Let me explain. It\u2019s not that hard! When Dylan went to the gym, the boys attacked him. Scott pushed him really hard and Dylan couldn\u2019t do anything about it. Scott Stay away from her! Abby Stop it! You\u2019re hurting him! A few days later Dylan asked Abby, \u201cSo, are you coming to the dance with me?\u201d And she said yes. He was very nervous when he picked her up. Abby\u2019s dad So, young man, you must be Dylan. The party was great. Everybody enjoyed the music and dancing. There was a big surprise that evening. Dylan and Abby were so proud. Presenter We proudly present this year\u2019s Homecoming King and Queen. At the end of the evening Dylan took Abby home. There it was, the perfect moment. But \u2026 Abby\u2019s dad Excuse me?   Living the dream? Interviewer Hello Jos\u00e9. Can I ask you a few questions for our magazine, please? Jos\u00e9 Hi. Sure. Interviewer You\u2019re new on the baseball team. Are you happy? Jos\u00e9 We won the first three matches, so I can\u2019t complain. Interviewer There are lots of players from Latin America here. When did you immigrate to the United States? Jos\u00e9 That was twelve years ago. I was ten. Interviewer That was a big decision for your parents. They left their home and moved to a foreign place. Jos\u00e9 Yes, but they were very poor in Cuba. My father had been unemployed for a long time. My parents wanted to give me and my sisters the best chances. Interviewer What were the first years like? Jos\u00e9 My parents had problems because they hadn\u2019t learned English in school. But there\u2019s a strong community of Cubans here in New York. So my parents opened a small shop for other immigrants. Interviewer And how did you feel? Jos\u00e9 At the beginning I was homesick. I missed my friends. But my parents had given up a lot for me and I slowly got used to my new life. Interviewer When did you begin your baseball career? Jos\u00e9 Before I was 15, I hadn\u2019t taken any sports seriously. Then I joined the baseball team in high school and we were very successful. After I had become the star of my team, my baseball career started. I\u2019ve been very lucky. I can live my dream. For most people it\u2019s much harder. Interviewer What about your plans for the future? Jos\u00e9 I\u2019m a US citizen now and my home is here. But I plan to help people in Cuba. Interviewer Thank you for your time.   Too young to work? Many big farms in California employ children, mostly from Latin America, to pick fruit or vegetables. Children have to help their parents earn their living because migrant parents often don\u2019t have enough income. It is difficult for them to get a better job because many of them don\u2019t have many qualifications or can hardly speak English. Some are even in the USA illegally. All laborers have the legal right to take breaks and get water to drink in the state of California. But in reality things are different. Fresno Weekly Magazine talked to Matteo (12) and his brother Ramon (14) from Sacramento, who have been working on different farms. Fresno Weekly What are the working conditions like for you? Matteo We have to get up at 4:30 in the morning. Buses drive us to the fields, where we work all day in the heat. We sometimes work more than ten hours a day and only earn the minimum wage or even less. The long hours in the fields make you tired. Fresno Weekly Ramon, how long have you been working in the fields? Ramon Since I was ten, just like my Dad. Fresno Weekly Do you have any health problems? Ramon Yes, because of the pesticides I always have difficulty breathing and I have a constant headache out there. But that\u2019s not all. Some people get injured working with the large machines. A federal law from 1938 allows farm owners to employ children from the age of twelve on big farms and even younger children on small farms. From the age of 14 teenagers can do farm work without their parents\u2019 consent. Officially, they are only allowed to work outside school hours, but some of them don\u2019t even finish high school. There are no statistics about how many children spend their days as farm helpers, but the estimate is about half a million. All recent attempts to change the law have failed."}

I grabbed all my money, which was less than a dollar. Then I was ready to go. I went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad.

The Harpers feed me and clean the litter tray for me every day. I get very upset when 1 they forget! But they\u2019re not bad. When I want to play, they play with me and stroke 2 me. That\u2019s \u201cpurr-fect\u201d 3 . During the day I often sleep because I must be fit for the night. It\u2019s nearly dark. Garden time! I like to watch birds there. So I meow 4 loudly, and Lilly opens the door. She\u2019s good at opening doors for me. Uh-oh, there\u2019s the neighbour\u2019s dog. He\u2019s in my garden again! I get angry, very angry. I growl 5 and make myself VERY BIG. We fight, and the fur flies 6 . He runs away. I always win! Silly dog! Ohh, what\u2019s this? I can smell fish from across the road 7 . I love it! I find a piece of fish near the bins. The extra food is yummy! And it\u2019s always time for food. Food \u2026 good idea. It\u2019s 5:30 in the morning, and I\u2019m tired and hungry. I meow loudly until one of the Harpers opens the door. They feed me and stroke me again. Where can I sleep today? ___ 1 when \u2013 wenn, falls ; 2 to stroke \u2013 streicheln ; 3 purr-fect \u2013 Wortspiel: to purr (schnurren), perfect (perfekt) ; 4 to meow \u2013 miauen ; 5 to growl \u2013 knurren ; 6 the fur flies \u2013 die Fetzen fliegen ; 7 road \u2013 die Stra\u00dfe   Greenwich Summer Festival Greenwich Summer Festival takes place every year in July or August.

Bye Gwen, see you tomorrow.\u201d Luke rushed down the stairs and got off the bus. He wanted to finish his game. He put his hand in his pocket, but his phone wasn\u2019t there! \u201cOh no, I must have forgotten it on the bus!\u201d He looked up. But the bus wasn\u2019t there any more. Luke went home and phoned the bus company. They wanted to help but first they needed a special number from his phone \u2013 and he didn\u2019t know the number! Luke didn\u2019t enjoy his dinner at all that night. Why wasn\u2019t he more careful with his phone? Suddenly the doorbell rang. \u201cGwen\u2019s here!\u201d shouted Luke\u2019s mum from the hall. Luke went to the door.

Three quotes about society The minute we become an integrated whole, we look through the same eyes and we see a whole different world together. ___ Azizah Al-Hibri, American philosopher and legal scholar Peace is not unity in similarity but unity in diversity, in the comparison and conciliation of differences. ___ Mikhail Gorbachev, former Russian president Unlike a drop of water which loses its identity when it joins the ocean, man does not lose his being in the society in which he lives. Man\u2019s life is independent. He is born not for the development of the society alone, but for the development of his self. ___ B. R. Ambedkar, former Indian Minister of Law and Justice   The House on Mango Street My name In English my name means hope. In Spanish it means too many letters. It means sadness, it means waiting. It is like the number nine. A muddy color. It is the Mexican records my father plays on Sunday mornings when he is shaving, songs like sobbing. It was my great-grandmother\u2019s name and now it is mine. She was a horse woman too, born like me in the Chinese year of the horse \u2013 which is supposed 1 to be bad luck if you\u2019re born female \u2013 but I think this is a Chinese lie because the Chinese, like the Mexicans, don\u2019t like their women strong. My great-grandmother. I would\u2019ve liked to have known her, a wild horse of a woman, so wild she wouldn\u2019t marry. Until my great-grandfather threw a sack over her head and carried her off. Just like that, as if she were a fancy chandelier 2 . That\u2019s the way he did it. And the story goes she never forgave him. She looked out the window her whole life, the way so many women sit their sadness on an elbow. I wonder if she made the best with what she got or was she sorry because she couldn\u2019t be all the things she wanted to be. Esperanza. I have inherited her name, but I don\u2019t want to inherit her place by the window. At school they say my name funny as if the syllables were made out of tin and hurt the roof of your mouth. But in Spanish my name is made out of a softer something, like silver, not quite as thick as my sister\u2019s name \u2013 Magdalena \u2013 which is uglier than mine. Magdalena who at least can come home and become Nenny. But I am always Esperanza. I would like to baptize 3 myself under a new name, a name more like the real me, the one nobody sees.

They decide to go on a trip to find the boy\u2019s body and prepare for the trip. The Gun My room was on the second floor, and it was really hot up there. I was glad I wasn\u2019t sleeping there that night, and the thought of where we were going made me excited again. I rolled up two blankets and tied an old belt around them. I grabbed all my money, which was less than a dollar. Then I was ready to go. I went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad. I was walking up Carbine Street towards the clubhouse when Chris caught up with me. His eyes were shining. \u201cGordie! You want to see something?\u201d \u201cSure. What?\u201d \u201cCome down here first.\u201d He pointed down an alley between two shops. \u201cWhat is it, Chris?\u201d \u201cCome on, I said!\u201d He ran down the alley and I ran after him. At the bottom, the smell from the trash was terrible. \u201cChris, I\u2019m going to puke, I\u2019m \u2013 \u201d But I forgot about the smell when Chris put his hand into his backpack and pulled out a big gun. \u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d \u201cFrom my dad\u2019s desk.\u201d \u201cMan, your dad\u2019s going to beat you when he finds out.\u201d Chris\u2019s eyes just went on dancing. \u201cHe isn\u2019t going to find out. He and his friends have got enough wine to keep them drunk for a week. I\u2019ll put it back before then.\u201d Chris hated alcohol \u2013 he\u2019d already seen too much of what it can do. He was the only one of us who didn\u2019t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they\u2019d stolen from their father. \u201cHave you got bullets for it?\u201d \u201cNine of them \u2013 all that was left in the box. He\u2019ll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.\u201d \u201cAny in it at the moment?\u201d \u201cNo, of course not. What do you think I am?\u201d I finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA \u2013 BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin \u2013 it was the work of an evil magician. \u201cWow!\u201d I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn\u2019t tell if he was amused or scared. \u201cYou did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!\u201d \u201cShut up! Let\u2019s go!\u201d I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. \u201cMan, it\u2019s a pity you couldn\u2019t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.\u201d \u201cYou knew there was a bullet in it, didn\u2019t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad\u2019s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.\u201d Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, \u201cWhat do you think we need a gun for?\u201d \u201cNothing, really,\u201d Chris said. \u201cExcept we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it\u2019s frightening out in the forest at night.\u201d Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?\u201d Teddy asked Vern. \u201cYeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it\u2019ll look as if we\u2019re there after dark.\u201d \u201cHey, man, great!\u201d I said, and slapped Vern on the back. For him, that was real thinking. He grinned. \u201cSo let\u2019s go,\u201d Teddy said. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly twelve already.\u201d Chris stood up and we gathered round him. \u201cWe\u2019ll walk across Beeman\u2019s field,\u201d he said, \u201cand then we\u2019ll get to the railway tracks and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.\u201d \u201cHow far is it, do you think?\u201d Teddy asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Chris. \u201cHarlow\u2019s big. We\u2019re going to have to walk at least twenty miles. Does that sound right to you, Gordie?\u201d \u201cYeah. Maybe more \u2013 thirty miles.\u201d \u201cCome on, you guys,\u201d Chris said, and picked up his backpack, blankets and water bottle.   Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? headline written by Pam Warner (published 07\/12\/16 in Health & Style ) author, date, source What is your Thanksgiving like? Turkey and pumpkin pie? American football on the sofa? In the last couple of years a new trend has become popular in the USA: More people like to eat better quality food and live a more active life. introduction It is slowly going out of fashion to live off convenience and frozen food. A number of people shop for organic food at special supermarkets instead. In some states farmers\u2019 markets offer a great variety of fresh vegetables and fruit from the region. \u201cThere are also dairy products, bread and meat without chemical additives at these markets. Organic food is not only much healthier but it tastes a lot better as well,\u201d explains Emma from Boston. So how about some healthy recipes for Thanksgiving? Maybe pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes? A roast turkey breast or a turkey roulade filled with apples and cranberries is delicious too. But there\u2019s more to a healthy lifestyle than just food. A lot of trend sports show that you can have fun, spend time with friends and stay fit at the same time. Have you found the right sport for you yet? If not, here is a suggestion: How about standup paddleboarding? If you like water, that\u2019s the ideal kind of sport for you. You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: \u201cDrinking too much alcohol isn\u2019t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?\u201d Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don\u2019t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion   A first date Dylan often thought about Abby.

We can do even better \u2013 by Lindsay Fern (21\/1\/2017) 1. Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy \u2013 after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world\u2019s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren\u2019t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is \u2018fracking\u2019, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, \u201cFracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.\u201d But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada\u2019s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the end of this yet,\u201d says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. \u201cCO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.\u201d 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven\u2019t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won\u2019t change. \u201cWhat worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.\u201d Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable \u2013 which means that when we have used them up, there simply won\u2019t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada\u2019s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better \u2013 and we will have to.   The sound of ice I\u2019m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn\u2019t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship\u2019s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the \u2018northwest passage\u2019, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn\u2019t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship\u2019s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It\u2019s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn\u2019t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we\u2019d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn\u2019t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn\u2019t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back\u2019s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can\u2019t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let\u2019s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I\u2019m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown.

The Body In \u201cThe Body\u201d, Gordie Lachance and his three friends learn that a boy from their area, in the state of Maine, has disappeared and is probably dead. They decide to go on a trip to find the boy\u2019s body and prepare for the trip. The Gun My room was on the second floor, and it was really hot up there. I was glad I wasn\u2019t sleeping there that night, and the thought of where we were going made me excited again. I rolled up two blankets and tied an old belt around them. I grabbed all my money, which was less than a dollar. Then I was ready to go. I went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad. I was walking up Carbine Street towards the clubhouse when Chris caught up with me. His eyes were shining. \u201cGordie! You want to see something?\u201d \u201cSure. What?\u201d \u201cCome down here first.\u201d He pointed down an alley between two shops. \u201cWhat is it, Chris?\u201d \u201cCome on, I said!\u201d He ran down the alley and I ran after him. At the bottom, the smell from the trash was terrible. \u201cChris, I\u2019m going to puke, I\u2019m \u2013 \u201d But I forgot about the smell when Chris put his hand into his backpack and pulled out a big gun. \u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d \u201cFrom my dad\u2019s desk.\u201d \u201cMan, your dad\u2019s going to beat you when he finds out.\u201d Chris\u2019s eyes just went on dancing. \u201cHe isn\u2019t going to find out. He and his friends have got enough wine to keep them drunk for a week. I\u2019ll put it back before then.\u201d Chris hated alcohol \u2013 he\u2019d already seen too much of what it can do. He was the only one of us who didn\u2019t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they\u2019d stolen from their father. \u201cHave you got bullets for it?\u201d \u201cNine of them \u2013 all that was left in the box. He\u2019ll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.\u201d \u201cAny in it at the moment?\u201d \u201cNo, of course not. What do you think I am?\u201d I finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA \u2013 BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin \u2013 it was the work of an evil magician. \u201cWow!\u201d I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn\u2019t tell if he was amused or scared. \u201cYou did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!\u201d \u201cShut up! Let\u2019s go!\u201d I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. \u201cMan, it\u2019s a pity you couldn\u2019t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.\u201d \u201cYou knew there was a bullet in it, didn\u2019t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad\u2019s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.\u201d Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, \u201cWhat do you think we need a gun for?\u201d \u201cNothing, really,\u201d Chris said. \u201cExcept we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it\u2019s frightening out in the forest at night.\u201d Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?\u201d Teddy asked Vern. \u201cYeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it\u2019ll look as if we\u2019re there after dark.\u201d \u201cHey, man, great!\u201d I said, and slapped Vern on the back. For him, that was real thinking. He grinned. \u201cSo let\u2019s go,\u201d Teddy said. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly twelve already.\u201d Chris stood up and we gathered round him. \u201cWe\u2019ll walk across Beeman\u2019s field,\u201d he said, \u201cand then we\u2019ll get to the railway tracks and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.\u201d \u201cHow far is it, do you think?\u201d Teddy asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Chris. \u201cHarlow\u2019s big. We\u2019re going to have to walk at least twenty miles. Does that sound right to you, Gordie?\u201d \u201cYeah. Maybe more \u2013 thirty miles.\u201d \u201cCome on, you guys,\u201d Chris said, and picked up his backpack, blankets and water bottle.   Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? headline written by Pam Warner (published 07\/12\/16 in Health & Style ) author, date, source What is your Thanksgiving like? Turkey and pumpkin pie? American football on the sofa? In the last couple of years a new trend has become popular in the USA: More people like to eat better quality food and live a more active life. introduction It is slowly going out of fashion to live off convenience and frozen food. A number of people shop for organic food at special supermarkets instead. In some states farmers\u2019 markets offer a great variety of fresh vegetables and fruit from the region. \u201cThere are also dairy products, bread and meat without chemical additives at these markets. Organic food is not only much healthier but it tastes a lot better as well,\u201d explains Emma from Boston. So how about some healthy recipes for Thanksgiving? Maybe pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes? A roast turkey breast or a turkey roulade filled with apples and cranberries is delicious too. But there\u2019s more to a healthy lifestyle than just food. A lot of trend sports show that you can have fun, spend time with friends and stay fit at the same time. Have you found the right sport for you yet? If not, here is a suggestion: How about standup paddleboarding? If you like water, that\u2019s the ideal kind of sport for you. You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: \u201cDrinking too much alcohol isn\u2019t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?\u201d Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don\u2019t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion   A first date Dylan often thought about Abby. He really liked her. But he was too shy to ask her out on a date. Dylan\u2019s friend Forget her. She\u2019s not interested in you. She has a boyfriend. One day his books fell out of his locker right when Abby showed up. With Scott in tow, of course. How embarrassing. Scott Who\u2019s that guy? Look at him! A few days later they had lunch together. Dylan helped Abby with her Science project. They didn\u2019t notice Scott and his football friends. Scott\u2019s friend Isn\u2019t she your girlfriend? Dylan Let me explain. It\u2019s not that hard! When Dylan went to the gym, the boys attacked him. Scott pushed him really hard and Dylan couldn\u2019t do anything about it. Scott Stay away from her! Abby Stop it! You\u2019re hurting him! A few days later Dylan asked Abby, \u201cSo, are you coming to the dance with me?\u201d And she said yes. He was very nervous when he picked her up. Abby\u2019s dad So, young man, you must be Dylan. The party was great. Everybody enjoyed the music and dancing. There was a big surprise that evening. Dylan and Abby were so proud. Presenter We proudly present this year\u2019s Homecoming King and Queen. At the end of the evening Dylan took Abby home. There it was, the perfect moment. But \u2026 Abby\u2019s dad Excuse me?   Living the dream? Interviewer Hello Jos\u00e9. Can I ask you a few questions for our magazine, please? Jos\u00e9 Hi. Sure. Interviewer You\u2019re new on the baseball team. Are you happy? Jos\u00e9 We won the first three matches, so I can\u2019t complain. Interviewer There are lots of players from Latin America here. When did you immigrate to the United States? Jos\u00e9 That was twelve years ago. I was ten. Interviewer That was a big decision for your parents. They left their home and moved to a foreign place. Jos\u00e9 Yes, but they were very poor in Cuba. My father had been unemployed for a long time. My parents wanted to give me and my sisters the best chances. Interviewer What were the first years like? Jos\u00e9 My parents had problems because they hadn\u2019t learned English in school. But there\u2019s a strong community of Cubans here in New York. So my parents opened a small shop for other immigrants. Interviewer And how did you feel? Jos\u00e9 At the beginning I was homesick. I missed my friends. But my parents had given up a lot for me and I slowly got used to my new life. Interviewer When did you begin your baseball career? Jos\u00e9 Before I was 15, I hadn\u2019t taken any sports seriously. Then I joined the baseball team in high school and we were very successful. After I had become the star of my team, my baseball career started. I\u2019ve been very lucky. I can live my dream. For most people it\u2019s much harder. Interviewer What about your plans for the future? Jos\u00e9 I\u2019m a US citizen now and my home is here. But I plan to help people in Cuba. Interviewer Thank you for your time.   Too young to work? Many big farms in California employ children, mostly from Latin America, to pick fruit or vegetables. Children have to help their parents earn their living because migrant parents often don\u2019t have enough income. It is difficult for them to get a better job because many of them don\u2019t have many qualifications or can hardly speak English. Some are even in the USA illegally. All laborers have the legal right to take breaks and get water to drink in the state of California. But in reality things are different. Fresno Weekly Magazine talked to Matteo (12) and his brother Ramon (14) from Sacramento, who have been working on different farms. Fresno Weekly What are the working conditions like for you? Matteo We have to get up at 4:30 in the morning. Buses drive us to the fields, where we work all day in the heat. We sometimes work more than ten hours a day and only earn the minimum wage or even less. The long hours in the fields make you tired. Fresno Weekly Ramon, how long have you been working in the fields? Ramon Since I was ten, just like my Dad. Fresno Weekly Do you have any health problems? Ramon Yes, because of the pesticides I always have difficulty breathing and I have a constant headache out there. But that\u2019s not all. Some people get injured working with the large machines. A federal law from 1938 allows farm owners to employ children from the age of twelve on big farms and even younger children on small farms. From the age of 14 teenagers can do farm work without their parents\u2019 consent. Officially, they are only allowed to work outside school hours, but some of them don\u2019t even finish high school. There are no statistics about how many children spend their days as farm helpers, but the estimate is about half a million. All recent attempts to change the law have failed."}

Water filled the ship until it sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD\u2019S LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship\u2019s builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. LOCAL MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland. The ship\u2019s doctor, Dr John Simpson, 37, was born in Belfast. His mother was optimistic when a letter from him arrived at her home yesterday. However, we have found out that he posted the letter during the ship\u2019s last stop. We now know that Dr Simpson did not survive. DOG SAVES LIVES Some were lucky and the ships which came to save the passengers of the Titanic found their lifeboat. According to a passenger, one of the dogs on board saved the lives of the people in one lifeboat. A ship only found this lifeboat in the dark night and the foggy weather because they heard the dog when it barked. HOW COULD IT HAPPEN? After the sinking of the Titanic a number of questions still need answers. Why did no one see the iceberg? Why did the ship break? Why were there only 20 lifeboats for 2,200 people on board? Why did lifeboats leave the ship when they were not yet full? And how can we make sure that an accident like this will never happen again? About 700 people survived the accident. Some ships today have over 6,500 passengers and crew. After the Titanic\u2019s accident there were laws that ships must have one lifeboat place for every person on board. Dr Simpson\u2019s last letter to his mother is now in the Belfast Titanic museum.   A deadly silence 1. My name is Jonas Fox and I\u2019m twelve years old. I work in the mines and my job is to sit near a door in the tunnel every day. I must open the door when the coal arrives. Then, after it\u2019s gone, I quickly close the door again. Every day I sit in the dark, but I\u2019m never scared. That\u2019s because my friend Billy is always there with me. Billy sings all day long. He\u2019s yellow with little black eyes which look like they are made of glass. Billy is a canary, you see? It\u2019s never boring with Billy around. I would love to sing too, but I can\u2019t even talk. 2. Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine killed 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there\u2019s gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine. One day Bart started to cough and he never stopped coughing after that. Then one night my brother coughed so badly that he died. That was when I stopped talking. I don\u2019t know why, really. I still had words in my head and I opened my mouth, but I couldn\u2019t speak. The men in the mine started to call me \u2018Silent Jonas\u2019 after that. They probably thought I was a bit strange. 4. The day when things got really bad started like any other. Billy was singing like he always did. I heard the people in the tunnels and the noise of the coal trucks. I opened the door and I felt a cold wind in the tunnel. I closed the door again. Billy stopped singing. For a moment I didn\u2019t understand. But then, suddenly, I did: There was gas in the mine! And it could explode any second. I didn\u2019t have time to run down the tunnel to warn the men. If only I could talk, if only I could shout! 5. I knew I had to warn everyone in the mine. So I opened my mouth and tried to say it: \u201cGas.\u201d But there was no sound. Nothing came out. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth again. Nothing. I panicked. We could die in here \u2013 I had to speak! I tried again. This time the sound was quiet, but I made a sound. At last! I opened the door and shouted, \u201cGas. Gas. GAS!\u201d A moment later I heard the sound of the miners\u2019 boots in the tunnels. I took Billy\u2019s cage and ran too. 6. I ran through the tunnel as fast as I could. But my head hurt and I couldn\u2019t breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn\u2019t tell where it was coming from. \u201cCome on, boy!\u201d it said. Somebody picked me up. I turned around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy\u2019s cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn\u2019t just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, \u201cWho warned us?\u201d \u201cMe!\u201d I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. \u201cSilent Jonas found his voice!\u201d a miner shouted. But how could I feel happy? My friend Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small \u2018Tweet\u2019. Billy was alive! I opened the cage \u2026 There were canaries in mines until 1987. Today miners use machines to find out if there is gas in the mine."}

{"anchor":"When did Caroline move to the countryside near Edinburgh?","positive":"What does she like about the city? Mention two things.","negative":"Look at the structure of the text We can do even better .   How does the author finish?    We can do even better \u2013 by Lindsay Fern (21\/1\/2017) 1. Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy \u2013 after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world\u2019s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren\u2019t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is \u2018fracking\u2019, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, \u201cFracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.\u201d But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada\u2019s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the end of this yet,\u201d says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. \u201cCO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.\u201d 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven\u2019t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won\u2019t change. \u201cWhat worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.\u201d Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable \u2013 which means that when we have used them up, there simply won\u2019t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada\u2019s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better \u2013 and we will have to."}

We can do even better \u2013 and we will have to.   The sound of ice I\u2019m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn\u2019t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship\u2019s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the \u2018northwest passage\u2019, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn\u2019t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship\u2019s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It\u2019s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn\u2019t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we\u2019d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn\u2019t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn\u2019t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back\u2019s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can\u2019t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let\u2019s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I\u2019m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown.

You forget everything,\u201d said Gwen. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d said Luke. He looked out of the window. \u201cOh no! This is my stop. I forgot where we are! Bye Gwen, see you tomorrow.\u201d Luke rushed down the stairs and got off the bus. He wanted to finish his game. He put his hand in his pocket, but his phone wasn\u2019t there! \u201cOh no, I must have forgotten it on the bus!\u201d He looked up. But the bus wasn\u2019t there any more. Luke went home and phoned the bus company. They wanted to help but first they needed a special number from his phone \u2013 and he didn\u2019t know the number! Luke didn\u2019t enjoy his dinner at all that night. Why wasn\u2019t he more careful with his phone? Suddenly the doorbell rang. \u201cGwen\u2019s here!\u201d shouted Luke\u2019s mum from the hall. Luke went to the door. Gwen and her dad were there. \u201cI heard something fall on the floor when you got off the bus,\u201d said Gwen. \u201cI asked a woman to see what it was.\u201d Gwen gave Luke his phone. \u201cWow!\u201d said Luke. \u201cToday is my lucky day! Thanks, Gwen.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what friends are for!\u201d said Gwen. \u201cCome on, Gwen. Let\u2019s get that pizza!\u201d said Gwen\u2019s dad. Luke put his phone in his pocket.

The Body In \u201cThe Body\u201d, Gordie Lachance and his three friends learn that a boy from their area, in the state of Maine, has disappeared and is probably dead. They decide to go on a trip to find the boy\u2019s body and prepare for the trip. The Gun My room was on the second floor, and it was really hot up there. I was glad I wasn\u2019t sleeping there that night, and the thought of where we were going made me excited again. I rolled up two blankets and tied an old belt around them. I grabbed all my money, which was less than a dollar. Then I was ready to go. I went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad. I was walking up Carbine Street towards the clubhouse when Chris caught up with me. His eyes were shining. \u201cGordie! You want to see something?\u201d \u201cSure. What?\u201d \u201cCome down here first.\u201d He pointed down an alley between two shops. \u201cWhat is it, Chris?\u201d \u201cCome on, I said!\u201d He ran down the alley and I ran after him. At the bottom, the smell from the trash was terrible. \u201cChris, I\u2019m going to puke, I\u2019m \u2013 \u201d But I forgot about the smell when Chris put his hand into his backpack and pulled out a big gun. \u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d \u201cFrom my dad\u2019s desk.\u201d \u201cMan, your dad\u2019s going to beat you when he finds out.\u201d Chris\u2019s eyes just went on dancing. \u201cHe isn\u2019t going to find out. He and his friends have got enough wine to keep them drunk for a week. I\u2019ll put it back before then.\u201d Chris hated alcohol \u2013 he\u2019d already seen too much of what it can do. He was the only one of us who didn\u2019t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they\u2019d stolen from their father. \u201cHave you got bullets for it?\u201d \u201cNine of them \u2013 all that was left in the box. He\u2019ll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.\u201d \u201cAny in it at the moment?\u201d \u201cNo, of course not. What do you think I am?\u201d I finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA \u2013 BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin \u2013 it was the work of an evil magician. \u201cWow!\u201d I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn\u2019t tell if he was amused or scared. \u201cYou did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!\u201d \u201cShut up! Let\u2019s go!\u201d I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. \u201cMan, it\u2019s a pity you couldn\u2019t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.\u201d \u201cYou knew there was a bullet in it, didn\u2019t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad\u2019s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.\u201d Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, \u201cWhat do you think we need a gun for?\u201d \u201cNothing, really,\u201d Chris said. \u201cExcept we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it\u2019s frightening out in the forest at night.\u201d Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?\u201d Teddy asked Vern. \u201cYeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it\u2019ll look as if we\u2019re there after dark.\u201d \u201cHey, man, great!\u201d I said, and slapped Vern on the back. For him, that was real thinking. He grinned. \u201cSo let\u2019s go,\u201d Teddy said. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly twelve already.\u201d Chris stood up and we gathered round him. \u201cWe\u2019ll walk across Beeman\u2019s field,\u201d he said, \u201cand then we\u2019ll get to the railway tracks and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.\u201d \u201cHow far is it, do you think?\u201d Teddy asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Chris. \u201cHarlow\u2019s big. We\u2019re going to have to walk at least twenty miles. Does that sound right to you, Gordie?\u201d \u201cYeah. Maybe more \u2013 thirty miles.\u201d \u201cCome on, you guys,\u201d Chris said, and picked up his backpack, blankets and water bottle.   Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? headline written by Pam Warner (published 07\/12\/16 in Health & Style ) author, date, source What is your Thanksgiving like? Turkey and pumpkin pie? American football on the sofa? In the last couple of years a new trend has become popular in the USA: More people like to eat better quality food and live a more active life. introduction It is slowly going out of fashion to live off convenience and frozen food. A number of people shop for organic food at special supermarkets instead. In some states farmers\u2019 markets offer a great variety of fresh vegetables and fruit from the region. \u201cThere are also dairy products, bread and meat without chemical additives at these markets. Organic food is not only much healthier but it tastes a lot better as well,\u201d explains Emma from Boston. So how about some healthy recipes for Thanksgiving? Maybe pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes? A roast turkey breast or a turkey roulade filled with apples and cranberries is delicious too. But there\u2019s more to a healthy lifestyle than just food. A lot of trend sports show that you can have fun, spend time with friends and stay fit at the same time. Have you found the right sport for you yet? If not, here is a suggestion: How about standup paddleboarding? If you like water, that\u2019s the ideal kind of sport for you. You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: \u201cDrinking too much alcohol isn\u2019t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?\u201d Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don\u2019t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion"}

We can do even better \u2013 by Lindsay Fern (21\/1\/2017) 1. Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy \u2013 after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world\u2019s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren\u2019t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is \u2018fracking\u2019, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, \u201cFracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.\u201d But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada\u2019s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the end of this yet,\u201d says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. \u201cCO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.\u201d 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven\u2019t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won\u2019t change. \u201cWhat worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.\u201d Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable \u2013 which means that when we have used them up, there simply won\u2019t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada\u2019s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better \u2013 and we will have to.   The sound of ice I\u2019m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn\u2019t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship\u2019s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the \u2018northwest passage\u2019, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn\u2019t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship\u2019s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It\u2019s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn\u2019t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we\u2019d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn\u2019t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn\u2019t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back\u2019s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can\u2019t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let\u2019s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I\u2019m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown. Stephen Samuel Stanley \u2013 ship\u2019s doctor, HMS Erebus   In New Zealand   Working in India Get to know India and work as a volunteer Teaching young children in an orphanage in Jaipur Building and repairing schools in Goa Helping stray dogs in Ranchi For more information contact Mrs Lal. (a.lal@vii.com) My name is Emma De Santis. I\u2019m from Germany and I\u2019m 18 years old. I took part in a project at an orphanage in Jaipur last year. My English isn\u2019t bad and I used to work as a babysitter for our neighbours\u2019 kids. I could choose to work from four weeks to ten months. I decided to stay for eight weeks. Before I went to India, I had to get all the important papers. I also knew that I would have to pay the organization almost \u20ac2,000. The flight was not included. So I decided to work in a supermarket to earn the money. When I got the contract for the project in India, I booked my flight and I was ready to go. When I arrived in Jaipur, I was very tired from the journey and the time difference. The heat, the noise and the smells made it even worse. But I still remember a cow lying in front of the phone shop. During the orientation days I met other volunteers from different countries, which was great. After that I met my host family. They were very friendly people. However, I was homesick during the first days, and I had some problems with the food. It was so spicy. At the time I thought, \u201cIf I don\u2019t feel better soon, I\u2019ll have to quit.\u201d But I got over it quickly. My job was great but challenging too. The working conditions were OK. I was teaching 10-year-old girls English and organizing some free-time activities for the younger ones. The staff were very helpful. They all spoke English, which made things a little easier. I quickly found out that things are different in India. Most people\u2019s attitude in India is \u201cWhatever happens, happens.\u201d And usually that\u2019s OK for everyone. Wherever I went, people were smiling at me. But they didn\u2019t just show interest in me, many of them actually stared at me. But you learn to ignore it. I can really recommend taking part in a project like this. I met wonderful people, made new friends and learned a lot about myself. If you go to India, you\u2019ll never forget it.   \u2018I have a dream\u2019 - Martin Luther King, Jr. On April 4, 1968 the African-American minister 1 and US civil rights 2 leader Martin Luther King, Junior was shot in Memphis, Tennessee. The week after his death there were violent protests in cities across the United States. But who was this man whose death shook both a nation and also people around the rest of the world? King was born in the American South, in Atlanta, Georgia, on January 15, 1929. He grew up in a religious family. His father was a Baptist pastor and his mother was a church organist. At that time the people in the American South were segregated 3 . Laws made sure that in the Southern states African-American people did not have the same rights as whites. They had to go to different schools and eat in different restaurants. They weren\u2019t allowed to work with white people. African Americans had to sit at the back of buses and give up their seats to white people. King never wanted to accept this segregation. When he was little, his best friend was a white boy. King, however, had to go to a school for African Americans, while his friend went to a school for whites. So King lost his friend. Over the years King realized how unfair his family and neighbors were treated. He wanted to fight for the civil rights of African Americans. At the age of 18 King decided to become a minister. He felt that the church could give him the best chance to help people and society. He finished college in 1951. He got married to his girlfriend Coretta Scott in 1953, and together they had four children. A year later he became pastor of a Baptist church in Montgomery, Alabama. Protests against racial segregation began in 1955. African-American Rosa Parks hadn\u2019t wanted to give up her bus seat to white people in the city of Montgomery. Rosa Parks was arrested. King started a campaign 4 . For 381 days people didn\u2019t use the city\u2019s public transportation. The campaign was led by Martin Luther King, Jr. During this time his house was bombed and he was arrested too. In the end racial segregation on all Montgomery public transportation was made illegal 5 . It was the first victory 6 for the Civil Rights Movement and it made King a very famous person. In 1957 King and other civil rights activists founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). They wanted to use non-violent protests to achieve 7 civil rights reform. King was influenced by Mahatma Gandhi and his successful non-violent protest against the British Empire in the 1940s. The SCLC started a campaign against racial segregation in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963. Everything was peaceful until the police used water cannons and police dogs against the protesters, even against children. When this was shown on national TV, many white Americans were shocked. The Birmingham campaign was successful and African Americans now had more access 8 to public places. \u2018White Only\u2019 and \u2018Black Only\u2019 signs were removed from restrooms 9 , for example. Early in the Birmingham campaign, King had been arrested again. In his cell he realized that freedom for African-American people would be a long and hard struggle 10 . Later that year King helped organize the March on Washington on August 28, 1963. Its goal was to protest against the way African Americans were treated in Southern states. The protesters wanted an end to racial segregation in schools and at work. They also wanted to protect workers from police brutality. More than 250,000 people joined the march. At the time it was the largest meeting of protesters in the history of Washington, D.C. During this event King gave his most famous speech \u2013 \u2018I have a dream\u2019. It became one of the greatest American speeches. Soon after, civil rights became the most important goal for black and white reformers in the United States. Most of the civil rights became law in 1964 and 1965. King got the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 for his role in the Civil Rights Movement. He was also named \u2018Person of the Year\u2019 by Time magazine. In March 1968 King went to Memphis, Tennessee. He wanted to support African-American workers there who were on strike 11 against bad working conditions. On April 4, 1968 he was shot. James Earl Ray, a white escaped convict 12 , was arrested and was sentenced 13 to 99 years in prison. Since 1983 the third Monday in January has become a national holiday 14 in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. The house where King was born and his grave in Atlanta are national monuments. Streets in towns and cities all over the United States have been named after him. King was the leader of the Civil Rights Movement for almost 13 years. During that time African Americans made a lot of progress on the way towards equality 15 in America. However, many black Americans still experience racial discrimination today. King is known as one of the greatest non-violent leaders in world history. ___ 1 minister [\u02c8m\u026an\u026ast\u0259] \u2212 Pfarrer, Pfarrerin ; 2 civil rights [\u02ccs\u026avl \u02c8ra\u026ats] \u2212 B\u00fcrgerrechte ; 3 segregated [\u02c8segr\u026age\u026at\u026ad] \u2212 getrennt (nach Hautfarbe) ; 4 campaign [k\u04d5\u02c8pe\u026an] \u2212 Kampagne, Aktion ; 5 illegal [\u026a\u02c8li:gl] \u2212 illegal, gesetzeswidrig ; 6 victory [\u02c8v\u026aktri] \u2212 Sieg ; 7 to achieve [\u0259\u02c8t\u222bi:v] \u2212 erreichen ; 8 access [\u02c8\u04d5kses] \u2212 Zugang, Zutritt ; 9 restroom [\u02c8rest\u02ccr\u028am] \u2212 Toilette ; 10 struggle [\u02c8str\u028cgl] \u2212 Kampf ; 11 to be on strike [\u0252n \u02c8stra\u026ak] \u2212 streiken ; 12 escaped convict [\u026a\u02ccske\u026apd \u02c8k\u0252nv\u026akt] \u2212 fl\u00fcchtiger Str\u00e4fling ; 13 to sentence [\u02c8sent\u0259ns] \u2212 verurteilen ; 14 national holiday [\u02ccn\u04d5\u222bnl \u02c8h\u0252l\u0259de\u026a] \u2212 (nationaler) Feiertag ; 15 equality [\u026a\u02c8kw\u0252l\u0259ti] \u2212 Gleichheit"}

A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.\u201d Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable \u2013 which means that when we have used them up, there simply won\u2019t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada\u2019s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better \u2013 and we will have to.   The sound of ice I\u2019m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn\u2019t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship\u2019s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the \u2018northwest passage\u2019, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn\u2019t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship\u2019s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It\u2019s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn\u2019t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we\u2019d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn\u2019t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn\u2019t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back\u2019s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can\u2019t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let\u2019s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I\u2019m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown.

Copy and complete the table. Job People Problems \u2026 \u2026 \u2026    We can do even better \u2013 by Lindsay Fern (21\/1\/2017) 1. Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy \u2013 after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world\u2019s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren\u2019t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is \u2018fracking\u2019, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, \u201cFracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.\u201d But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada\u2019s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the end of this yet,\u201d says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. \u201cCO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.\u201d 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven\u2019t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won\u2019t change. \u201cWhat worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.\u201d Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable \u2013 which means that when we have used them up, there simply won\u2019t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada\u2019s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better \u2013 and we will have to.   The sound of ice I\u2019m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn\u2019t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship\u2019s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the \u2018northwest passage\u2019, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn\u2019t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship\u2019s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It\u2019s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn\u2019t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we\u2019d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn\u2019t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn\u2019t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back\u2019s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can\u2019t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let\u2019s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I\u2019m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown.

(a.lal@vii.com) My name is Emma De Santis. I\u2019m from Germany and I\u2019m 18 years old. I took part in a project at an orphanage in Jaipur last year. My English isn\u2019t bad and I used to work as a babysitter for our neighbours\u2019 kids. I could choose to work from four weeks to ten months. I decided to stay for eight weeks. Before I went to India, I had to get all the important papers. I also knew that I would have to pay the organization almost \u20ac2,000. The flight was not included. So I decided to work in a supermarket to earn the money. When I got the contract for the project in India, I booked my flight and I was ready to go. When I arrived in Jaipur, I was very tired from the journey and the time difference. The heat, the noise and the smells made it even worse. But I still remember a cow lying in front of the phone shop. During the orientation days I met other volunteers from different countries, which was great. After that I met my host family. They were very friendly people. However, I was homesick during the first days, and I had some problems with the food. It was so spicy. At the time I thought, \u201cIf I don\u2019t feel better soon, I\u2019ll have to quit.\u201d But I got over it quickly. My job was great but challenging too. The working conditions were OK. I was teaching 10-year-old girls English and organizing some free-time activities for the younger ones. The staff were very helpful. They all spoke English, which made things a little easier. I quickly found out that things are different in India. Most people\u2019s attitude in India is \u201cWhatever happens, happens.\u201d And usually that\u2019s OK for everyone. Wherever I went, people were smiling at me. But they didn\u2019t just show interest in me, many of them actually stared at me. But you learn to ignore it. I can really recommend taking part in a project like this. I met wonderful people, made new friends and learned a lot about myself. If you go to India, you\u2019ll never forget it."}

The Titanic disaster The Belfast News Wednesday, 17th April 1912 TWO DAYS AFTER \u2013 MORE FACTS The giant ship Titanic, which was built here in Belfast\u2019s shipyard, hit an iceberg on 14th April, shortly before midnight. Water filled the ship until it sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD\u2019S LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship\u2019s builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. LOCAL MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland. The ship\u2019s doctor, Dr John Simpson, 37, was born in Belfast. His mother was optimistic when a letter from him arrived at her home yesterday. However, we have found out that he posted the letter during the ship\u2019s last stop. We now know that Dr Simpson did not survive. DOG SAVES LIVES Some were lucky and the ships which came to save the passengers of the Titanic found their lifeboat. According to a passenger, one of the dogs on board saved the lives of the people in one lifeboat. A ship only found this lifeboat in the dark night and the foggy weather because they heard the dog when it barked. HOW COULD IT HAPPEN? After the sinking of the Titanic a number of questions still need answers. Why did no one see the iceberg? Why did the ship break? Why were there only 20 lifeboats for 2,200 people on board? Why did lifeboats leave the ship when they were not yet full? And how can we make sure that an accident like this will never happen again? About 700 people survived the accident. Some ships today have over 6,500 passengers and crew. After the Titanic\u2019s accident there were laws that ships must have one lifeboat place for every person on board. Dr Simpson\u2019s last letter to his mother is now in the Belfast Titanic museum.   A deadly silence 1. My name is Jonas Fox and I\u2019m twelve years old. I work in the mines and my job is to sit near a door in the tunnel every day. I must open the door when the coal arrives. Then, after it\u2019s gone, I quickly close the door again. Every day I sit in the dark, but I\u2019m never scared. That\u2019s because my friend Billy is always there with me. Billy sings all day long. He\u2019s yellow with little black eyes which look like they are made of glass. Billy is a canary, you see? It\u2019s never boring with Billy around. I would love to sing too, but I can\u2019t even talk. 2. Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine killed 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there\u2019s gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine. One day Bart started to cough and he never stopped coughing after that. Then one night my brother coughed so badly that he died. That was when I stopped talking. I don\u2019t know why, really. I still had words in my head and I opened my mouth, but I couldn\u2019t speak. The men in the mine started to call me \u2018Silent Jonas\u2019 after that. They probably thought I was a bit strange. 4. The day when things got really bad started like any other. Billy was singing like he always did. I heard the people in the tunnels and the noise of the coal trucks. I opened the door and I felt a cold wind in the tunnel. I closed the door again. Billy stopped singing. For a moment I didn\u2019t understand. But then, suddenly, I did: There was gas in the mine! And it could explode any second. I didn\u2019t have time to run down the tunnel to warn the men. If only I could talk, if only I could shout! 5. I knew I had to warn everyone in the mine. So I opened my mouth and tried to say it: \u201cGas.\u201d But there was no sound. Nothing came out. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth again. Nothing. I panicked. We could die in here \u2013 I had to speak! I tried again. This time the sound was quiet, but I made a sound. At last! I opened the door and shouted, \u201cGas. Gas. GAS!\u201d A moment later I heard the sound of the miners\u2019 boots in the tunnels. I took Billy\u2019s cage and ran too. 6. I ran through the tunnel as fast as I could. But my head hurt and I couldn\u2019t breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn\u2019t tell where it was coming from. \u201cCome on, boy!\u201d it said. Somebody picked me up. I turned around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy\u2019s cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn\u2019t just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, \u201cWho warned us?\u201d \u201cMe!\u201d I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. \u201cSilent Jonas found his voice!\u201d a miner shouted. But how could I feel happy? My friend Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small \u2018Tweet\u2019. Billy was alive! I opened the cage \u2026 There were canaries in mines until 1987. Today miners use machines to find out if there is gas in the mine.   The Norman conquest The old king of England, Edward, died in 1066. He had no children and both his Anglo-Saxon brother-in-law, Harold, and his French cousin, William, Duke of Normandy, wanted to be the next king of England. Harold made himself king, and William was very angry. So what did he do next? He sailed to England with his army \u2026 Harold and William fought the battle on Senlac Hill, near Hastings. William\u2019s men were knights and they were better trained. They fought on horses and were good archers. Harold\u2019s men fought on foot and they were already tired from an earlier battle at Stamford Bridge, 200 miles away in the north of England. (Yes, they had to walk those 200 miles!) How do we know what happened during the Battle of Hastings? Well, we have the 70-metre long Bayeux Tapestry to tell us! The tapestry is like a comic and it tells the story of the battle. It tells us that Harold died when he got an arrow in his eye, but we don\u2019t know if this really happened. William won the Battle of Hastings and he became king of England on Christmas Day 1066. Today we know him as William the Conqueror. He was a big castle fan and built lots of them in England, including part of the Tower of London. He also took land from the Anglo-Saxons and gave it to his Norman friends. Did the Normans change England? Yes, of course they did! For example, they brought many new words to the English language. Words like \u2018pork\u2019 and \u2018garden\u2019 come from this time. Guess what? There are still many English people who have Norman surnames, like Archer or Darcy. Before the Normans came to England, most people didn\u2019t even have surnames.

Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy \u2013 after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world\u2019s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren\u2019t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is \u2018fracking\u2019, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, \u201cFracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.\u201d But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada\u2019s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the end of this yet,\u201d says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. \u201cCO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.\u201d 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven\u2019t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won\u2019t change. \u201cWhat worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.\u201d Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable \u2013 which means that when we have used them up, there simply won\u2019t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada\u2019s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better \u2013 and we will have to.   The sound of ice I\u2019m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn\u2019t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship\u2019s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the \u2018northwest passage\u2019, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn\u2019t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship\u2019s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It\u2019s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn\u2019t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we\u2019d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn\u2019t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn\u2019t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back\u2019s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can\u2019t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let\u2019s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I\u2019m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown.

Read your reports to your group and choose the best article.    We can do even better \u2013 by Lindsay Fern (21\/1\/2017) 1. Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy \u2013 after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world\u2019s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren\u2019t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is \u2018fracking\u2019, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, \u201cFracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.\u201d But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada\u2019s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the end of this yet,\u201d says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. \u201cCO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.\u201d 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven\u2019t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won\u2019t change. \u201cWhat worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.\u201d Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable \u2013 which means that when we have used them up, there simply won\u2019t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada\u2019s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better \u2013 and we will have to.   The sound of ice I\u2019m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn\u2019t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship\u2019s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the \u2018northwest passage\u2019, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn\u2019t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship\u2019s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It\u2019s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn\u2019t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we\u2019d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn\u2019t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn\u2019t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back\u2019s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can\u2019t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let\u2019s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I\u2019m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown.

(a.lal@vii.com) My name is Emma De Santis. I\u2019m from Germany and I\u2019m 18 years old. I took part in a project at an orphanage in Jaipur last year. My English isn\u2019t bad and I used to work as a babysitter for our neighbours\u2019 kids. I could choose to work from four weeks to ten months. I decided to stay for eight weeks. Before I went to India, I had to get all the important papers. I also knew that I would have to pay the organization almost \u20ac2,000. The flight was not included. So I decided to work in a supermarket to earn the money. When I got the contract for the project in India, I booked my flight and I was ready to go. When I arrived in Jaipur, I was very tired from the journey and the time difference. The heat, the noise and the smells made it even worse. But I still remember a cow lying in front of the phone shop. During the orientation days I met other volunteers from different countries, which was great. After that I met my host family. They were very friendly people. However, I was homesick during the first days, and I had some problems with the food. It was so spicy. At the time I thought, \u201cIf I don\u2019t feel better soon, I\u2019ll have to quit.\u201d But I got over it quickly. My job was great but challenging too. The working conditions were OK. I was teaching 10-year-old girls English and organizing some free-time activities for the younger ones. The staff were very helpful. They all spoke English, which made things a little easier. I quickly found out that things are different in India. Most people\u2019s attitude in India is \u201cWhatever happens, happens.\u201d And usually that\u2019s OK for everyone. Wherever I went, people were smiling at me. But they didn\u2019t just show interest in me, many of them actually stared at me. But you learn to ignore it. I can really recommend taking part in a project like this. I met wonderful people, made new friends and learned a lot about myself. If you go to India, you\u2019ll never forget it."}

I want to be with my friends. But I\u2019m not. Mum and Dad sent me to stay with Aunt Susan for six long days. To a village! In the middle of nowhere. All you can see are fields, trees and some animals. There are no shops, no caf\u00e9s and no buses. No skate park either! It\u2019s so boring! How can people live here? There was a party in the village this evening. But it wasn\u2019t fun. There was a barbecue 1 and then singing and dancing. But the music was awful. I was so bored that I turned their music off and played some hip-hop 2 instead. Everybody was mad and shouted at me. I laughed at them and left. I hate this place and I hate these people. How can birds be so loud? Some of them started singing at four in the morning! Later the church bells 3 rang 4 . Nothing happened today. Just another boring day. When can I go home? Nothing! Aunt Susan wanted me to help with the cows and in the garden, but I stayed in my room and watched films. The village boys tried to pick me up for a football game. I told them that I didn\u2019t have my football shoes and couldn\u2019t play. I can\u2019t believe what happened last night. I woke up in the middle of the night because there was a loud noise in the house. I went to the kitchen and saw Aunt Susan there. She was on the phone, and she was very excited. When she saw me, she told me to come with her. Rosalie needed help. I didn\u2019t know who Rosalie was. I was surprised when I saw that Rosalie was one of Aunt Susan\u2019s cows. She needed help with her calf. Some other people from the village were there too. They were all very calm and knew what to do. They told me to hold the light so that the vet could see well. I could hardly look. That noise! And it smelt terrible. Yuck! 5 Then it was there. A little calf. So sweet, so clumsy. We all felt very happy. I was so tired but so excited. I got up early again. I just had to see if the calf was OK. It was. It stood next to Rosalie and drank its milk. It\u2019s the most beautiful little cow I\u2019ve ever seen 6 .

Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy \u2013 after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world\u2019s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren\u2019t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is \u2018fracking\u2019, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, \u201cFracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.\u201d But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada\u2019s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the end of this yet,\u201d says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. \u201cCO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.\u201d 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven\u2019t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won\u2019t change. \u201cWhat worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.\u201d Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable \u2013 which means that when we have used them up, there simply won\u2019t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada\u2019s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better \u2013 and we will have to.   The sound of ice I\u2019m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn\u2019t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship\u2019s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the \u2018northwest passage\u2019, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn\u2019t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship\u2019s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It\u2019s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn\u2019t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we\u2019d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn\u2019t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn\u2019t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back\u2019s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can\u2019t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let\u2019s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I\u2019m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown.

What\u2019s your favourite pizza, Luke?\u201d Luke didn\u2019t answer. \u201cDid you hear me?\u201d asked Gwen. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m playing this game on my phone,\u201d said Luke. \u201cI have a really high score. Look!\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t see that,\u201d said Gwen. \u201cSorry. I forgot you have a problem with your eyes,\u201d said Luke. \u201cYou forgot Dave\u2019s birthday. You forgot your homework. You forget everything,\u201d said Gwen. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d said Luke. He looked out of the window. \u201cOh no! This is my stop. I forgot where we are! Bye Gwen, see you tomorrow.\u201d Luke rushed down the stairs and got off the bus. He wanted to finish his game. He put his hand in his pocket, but his phone wasn\u2019t there! \u201cOh no, I must have forgotten it on the bus!\u201d He looked up. But the bus wasn\u2019t there any more. Luke went home and phoned the bus company. They wanted to help but first they needed a special number from his phone \u2013 and he didn\u2019t know the number! Luke didn\u2019t enjoy his dinner at all that night. Why wasn\u2019t he more careful with his phone? Suddenly the doorbell rang. \u201cGwen\u2019s here!\u201d shouted Luke\u2019s mum from the hall. Luke went to the door. Gwen and her dad were there. \u201cI heard something fall on the floor when you got off the bus,\u201d said Gwen. \u201cI asked a woman to see what it was.\u201d Gwen gave Luke his phone. \u201cWow!\u201d said Luke. \u201cToday is my lucky day! Thanks, Gwen.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what friends are for!\u201d said Gwen. \u201cCome on, Gwen. Let\u2019s get that pizza!\u201d said Gwen\u2019s dad. Luke put his phone in his pocket. It really was his lucky day. Maybe he could get his best ever high score too.   How I won a prize The TV show \u2018Teen chef of the year\u2019 tries to find the UK\u2019s best young chef.

Ambition: to have my own restaurant   The amazing story of Dora White Narrator Dora White lives in the small village of Aldham, many miles from London. (A girl and an old woman are at a bus stop in the village. The girl has a bag. She has money in her hands.) Dora One, two, three, four pounds fifty. Yes! I have enough money for the bus to London. Old woman Why do young people always want to go to London? It\u2019s dirty and not safe. Dora That\u2019s not true. It\u2019s the most amazing city in the world. And it\u2019s the place where dreams come true 1 . London is the place for me! Old woman I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s an awful place. (Dora looks down the road. There is the sound of a bus.) Dora Here\u2019s my bus. Oh \u2026 and my name\u2019s Dora White. Remember that name, because you\u2019ll hear it again 2 when I\u2019m famous. (Dora takes her bag. The old woman shakes her head. The lights go down 3 .) Narrator When Dora arrives in London, she gets a job. (Dora is in a busy restaurant kitchen. She is doing the washing up 4 . A chef and a waiter are in the kitchen. There are dirty plates, glasses and pots next to Dora.) Waiter I need six plates and glasses now! Dora One moment, please. Chef Work faster. I need three clean pots now. Dora Yes, chef. Chef Where are they? I need them now! Dora You can have them in a minute. I\u2019m busy with these plates. (Dora gives the plates to the waiter.) Waiter These plates are dirty! Dora I\u2019m sorry! Chef You are useless! Dora No, I\u2019m not. Chef You can go, Nora! Never come back! Dora It\u2019s not Nora. It\u2019s Dora. Dora White. Remember that name, because you\u2019ll hear it again when I\u2019m famous. (Dora exits the stage 5 on the right. The waiter and the chef shake their heads.) (The lights go down.) Narrator Dora\u2019s life in London isn\u2019t like it was in her dreams. (Dora is at a London bus stop with her bag. She looks very sad.) Dora Maybe London isn\u2019t the place for me. (Dora sees a leaflet on the road. She takes it and looks at it.) (She reads from the leaflet.) Three Lions Hotel. We need kitchen workers for our very special restaurant. We are a friendly restaurant, but you must be hard-working and determined. (Dora smiles and stands up straight. There is the sound of a bus.) Bus driver (From off the stage 6 , on the left) Do you want to get on? This is the last bus to Aldham today. Dora No thanks. I want to stay here. London is the place for me. (A young woman walks past Dora.) Dora Excuse me. Can you tell me the way to the Three Lions Hotel, please? Young woman The Three Lions Hotel? Yes, of course. Go straight on. It\u2019s on the right.

I want to be with my friends. But I\u2019m not. Mum and Dad sent me to stay with Aunt Susan for six long days. To a village! In the middle of nowhere. All you can see are fields, trees and some animals. There are no shops, no caf\u00e9s and no buses. No skate park either! It\u2019s so boring! How can people live here? There was a party in the village this evening. But it wasn\u2019t fun. There was a barbecue 1 and then singing and dancing. But the music was awful. I was so bored that I turned their music off and played some hip-hop 2 instead. Everybody was mad and shouted at me. I laughed at them and left. I hate this place and I hate these people. How can birds be so loud? Some of them started singing at four in the morning! Later the church bells 3 rang 4 . Nothing happened today. Just another boring day. When can I go home? Nothing! Aunt Susan wanted me to help with the cows and in the garden, but I stayed in my room and watched films. The village boys tried to pick me up for a football game. I told them that I didn\u2019t have my football shoes and couldn\u2019t play. I can\u2019t believe what happened last night. I woke up in the middle of the night because there was a loud noise in the house. I went to the kitchen and saw Aunt Susan there. She was on the phone, and she was very excited. When she saw me, she told me to come with her. Rosalie needed help. I didn\u2019t know who Rosalie was. I was surprised when I saw that Rosalie was one of Aunt Susan\u2019s cows. She needed help with her calf. Some other people from the village were there too. They were all very calm and knew what to do. They told me to hold the light so that the vet could see well. I could hardly look. That noise! And it smelt terrible. Yuck! 5 Then it was there. A little calf. So sweet, so clumsy. We all felt very happy. I was so tired but so excited. I got up early again. I just had to see if the calf was OK. It was. It stood next to Rosalie and drank its milk. It\u2019s the most beautiful little cow I\u2019ve ever seen 6 . I think I\u2019ll ask Aunt Susan if I can come back again. I think it\u2019s not that bad here. ___ 1 barbecue \u2013 Grillparty ; 2 hip-hop \u2013 Hip Hop (Musikrichtung) ; 3 bell \u2013 die Glocke ; 4 ring \u2013 l\u00e4uten ; 5 yuck \u2013 igitt 6 the most beautiful cow I\u2019ve ever seen \u2013 die sch\u00f6nste Kuh, die ich je gesehen habe   Dan\u2019s holidays in the country Holidays!

Luke and Gwen were on the bus. \u201cDad said we can get a takeaway pizza tonight,\u201d said Gwen. \u201cI love tuna pizza. What\u2019s your favourite pizza, Luke?\u201d Luke didn\u2019t answer. \u201cDid you hear me?\u201d asked Gwen. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m playing this game on my phone,\u201d said Luke. \u201cI have a really high score. Look!\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t see that,\u201d said Gwen. \u201cSorry. I forgot you have a problem with your eyes,\u201d said Luke. \u201cYou forgot Dave\u2019s birthday. You forgot your homework. You forget everything,\u201d said Gwen. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d said Luke. He looked out of the window. \u201cOh no! This is my stop. I forgot where we are! Bye Gwen, see you tomorrow.\u201d Luke rushed down the stairs and got off the bus. He wanted to finish his game. He put his hand in his pocket, but his phone wasn\u2019t there! \u201cOh no, I must have forgotten it on the bus!\u201d He looked up. But the bus wasn\u2019t there any more. Luke went home and phoned the bus company. They wanted to help but first they needed a special number from his phone \u2013 and he didn\u2019t know the number! Luke didn\u2019t enjoy his dinner at all that night. Why wasn\u2019t he more careful with his phone? Suddenly the doorbell rang. \u201cGwen\u2019s here!\u201d shouted Luke\u2019s mum from the hall. Luke went to the door. Gwen and her dad were there. \u201cI heard something fall on the floor when you got off the bus,\u201d said Gwen. \u201cI asked a woman to see what it was.\u201d Gwen gave Luke his phone. \u201cWow!\u201d said Luke. \u201cToday is my lucky day! Thanks, Gwen.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what friends are for!\u201d said Gwen. \u201cCome on, Gwen. Let\u2019s get that pizza!\u201d said Gwen\u2019s dad. Luke put his phone in his pocket.

Ambition: to have my own restaurant   The amazing story of Dora White Narrator Dora White lives in the small village of Aldham, many miles from London. (A girl and an old woman are at a bus stop in the village. The girl has a bag. She has money in her hands.) Dora One, two, three, four pounds fifty. Yes! I have enough money for the bus to London. Old woman Why do young people always want to go to London? It\u2019s dirty and not safe. Dora That\u2019s not true. It\u2019s the most amazing city in the world.

There are dirty plates, glasses and pots next to Dora.) Waiter I need six plates and glasses now! Dora One moment, please. Chef Work faster. I need three clean pots now. Dora Yes, chef. Chef Where are they? I need them now! Dora You can have them in a minute. I\u2019m busy with these plates. (Dora gives the plates to the waiter.) Waiter These plates are dirty! Dora I\u2019m sorry!

Narrator Dora\u2019s life in London isn\u2019t like it was in her dreams. (Dora is at a London bus stop with her bag. She looks very sad.) Dora Maybe London isn\u2019t the place for me. (Dora sees a leaflet on the road. She takes it and looks at it.) (She reads from the leaflet.) Three Lions Hotel. We need kitchen workers for our very special restaurant. We are a friendly restaurant, but you must be hard-working and determined. (Dora smiles and stands up straight. There is the sound of a bus.) Bus driver (From off the stage 6 , on the left) Do you want to get on? This is the last bus to Aldham today. Dora No thanks. I want to stay here. London is the place for me. (A young woman walks past Dora.) Dora Excuse me. Can you tell me the way to the Three Lions Hotel, please? Young woman The Three Lions Hotel? Yes, of course. Go straight on. It\u2019s on the right.

I want to be with my friends. But I\u2019m not. Mum and Dad sent me to stay with Aunt Susan for six long days. To a village! In the middle of nowhere. All you can see are fields, trees and some animals. There are no shops, no caf\u00e9s and no buses. No skate park either! It\u2019s so boring! How can people live here? There was a party in the village this evening. But it wasn\u2019t fun. There was a barbecue 1 and then singing and dancing. But the music was awful. I was so bored that I turned their music off and played some hip-hop 2 instead. Everybody was mad and shouted at me. I laughed at them and left. I hate this place and I hate these people. How can birds be so loud? Some of them started singing at four in the morning! Later the church bells 3 rang 4 . Nothing happened today. Just another boring day. When can I go home? Nothing! Aunt Susan wanted me to help with the cows and in the garden, but I stayed in my room and watched films. The village boys tried to pick me up for a football game. I told them that I didn\u2019t have my football shoes and couldn\u2019t play. I can\u2019t believe what happened last night. I woke up in the middle of the night because there was a loud noise in the house. I went to the kitchen and saw Aunt Susan there. She was on the phone, and she was very excited. When she saw me, she told me to come with her. Rosalie needed help. I didn\u2019t know who Rosalie was. I was surprised when I saw that Rosalie was one of Aunt Susan\u2019s cows. She needed help with her calf. Some other people from the village were there too. They were all very calm and knew what to do. They told me to hold the light so that the vet could see well. I could hardly look. That noise! And it smelt terrible. Yuck! 5 Then it was there. A little calf. So sweet, so clumsy. We all felt very happy. I was so tired but so excited. I got up early again. I just had to see if the calf was OK. It was. It stood next to Rosalie and drank its milk. It\u2019s the most beautiful little cow I\u2019ve ever seen 6 .

How does the author finish?    We can do even better \u2013 by Lindsay Fern (21\/1\/2017) 1. Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy \u2013 after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world\u2019s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren\u2019t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is \u2018fracking\u2019, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, \u201cFracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.\u201d But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada\u2019s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the end of this yet,\u201d says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. \u201cCO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.\u201d 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven\u2019t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won\u2019t change. \u201cWhat worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.\u201d Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable \u2013 which means that when we have used them up, there simply won\u2019t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada\u2019s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better \u2013 and we will have to."}

We can do even better \u2013 by Lindsay Fern (21\/1\/2017) 1. Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy \u2013 after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world\u2019s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren\u2019t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is \u2018fracking\u2019, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, \u201cFracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.\u201d But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada\u2019s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the end of this yet,\u201d says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. \u201cCO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.\u201d 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven\u2019t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won\u2019t change. \u201cWhat worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.\u201d Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable \u2013 which means that when we have used them up, there simply won\u2019t be any more.

We can do even better \u2013 and we will have to.   The sound of ice I\u2019m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn\u2019t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship\u2019s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the \u2018northwest passage\u2019, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn\u2019t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship\u2019s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It\u2019s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn\u2019t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we\u2019d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn\u2019t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn\u2019t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back\u2019s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can\u2019t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let\u2019s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I\u2019m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown.

(a.lal@vii.com) My name is Emma De Santis. I\u2019m from Germany and I\u2019m 18 years old. I took part in a project at an orphanage in Jaipur last year. My English isn\u2019t bad and I used to work as a babysitter for our neighbours\u2019 kids. I could choose to work from four weeks to ten months. I decided to stay for eight weeks. Before I went to India, I had to get all the important papers. I also knew that I would have to pay the organization almost \u20ac2,000. The flight was not included. So I decided to work in a supermarket to earn the money. When I got the contract for the project in India, I booked my flight and I was ready to go. When I arrived in Jaipur, I was very tired from the journey and the time difference. The heat, the noise and the smells made it even worse. But I still remember a cow lying in front of the phone shop. During the orientation days I met other volunteers from different countries, which was great. After that I met my host family. They were very friendly people. However, I was homesick during the first days, and I had some problems with the food. It was so spicy. At the time I thought, \u201cIf I don\u2019t feel better soon, I\u2019ll have to quit.\u201d But I got over it quickly. My job was great but challenging too. The working conditions were OK. I was teaching 10-year-old girls English and organizing some free-time activities for the younger ones. The staff were very helpful. They all spoke English, which made things a little easier. I quickly found out that things are different in India. Most people\u2019s attitude in India is \u201cWhatever happens, happens.\u201d And usually that\u2019s OK for everyone. Wherever I went, people were smiling at me. But they didn\u2019t just show interest in me, many of them actually stared at me. But you learn to ignore it. I can really recommend taking part in a project like this. I met wonderful people, made new friends and learned a lot about myself. If you go to India, you\u2019ll never forget it.   \u2018I have a dream\u2019 - Martin Luther King, Jr. On April 4, 1968 the African-American minister 1 and US civil rights 2 leader Martin Luther King, Junior was shot in Memphis, Tennessee. The week after his death there were violent protests in cities across the United States. But who was this man whose death shook both a nation and also people around the rest of the world? King was born in the American South, in Atlanta, Georgia, on January 15, 1929. He grew up in a religious family. His father was a Baptist pastor and his mother was a church organist. At that time the people in the American South were segregated 3 . Laws made sure that in the Southern states African-American people did not have the same rights as whites. They had to go to different schools and eat in different restaurants. They weren\u2019t allowed to work with white people. African Americans had to sit at the back of buses and give up their seats to white people. King never wanted to accept this segregation. When he was little, his best friend was a white boy. King, however, had to go to a school for African Americans, while his friend went to a school for whites. So King lost his friend. Over the years King realized how unfair his family and neighbors were treated. He wanted to fight for the civil rights of African Americans. At the age of 18 King decided to become a minister. He felt that the church could give him the best chance to help people and society. He finished college in 1951. He got married to his girlfriend Coretta Scott in 1953, and together they had four children. A year later he became pastor of a Baptist church in Montgomery, Alabama. Protests against racial segregation began in 1955. African-American Rosa Parks hadn\u2019t wanted to give up her bus seat to white people in the city of Montgomery. Rosa Parks was arrested. King started a campaign 4 . For 381 days people didn\u2019t use the city\u2019s public transportation. The campaign was led by Martin Luther King, Jr. During this time his house was bombed and he was arrested too. In the end racial segregation on all Montgomery public transportation was made illegal 5 . It was the first victory 6 for the Civil Rights Movement and it made King a very famous person. In 1957 King and other civil rights activists founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). They wanted to use non-violent protests to achieve 7 civil rights reform. King was influenced by Mahatma Gandhi and his successful non-violent protest against the British Empire in the 1940s. The SCLC started a campaign against racial segregation in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963. Everything was peaceful until the police used water cannons and police dogs against the protesters, even against children. When this was shown on national TV, many white Americans were shocked. The Birmingham campaign was successful and African Americans now had more access 8 to public places. \u2018White Only\u2019 and \u2018Black Only\u2019 signs were removed from restrooms 9 , for example. Early in the Birmingham campaign, King had been arrested again. In his cell he realized that freedom for African-American people would be a long and hard struggle 10 . Later that year King helped organize the March on Washington on August 28, 1963. Its goal was to protest against the way African Americans were treated in Southern states. The protesters wanted an end to racial segregation in schools and at work. They also wanted to protect workers from police brutality. More than 250,000 people joined the march. At the time it was the largest meeting of protesters in the history of Washington, D.C. During this event King gave his most famous speech \u2013 \u2018I have a dream\u2019. It became one of the greatest American speeches. Soon after, civil rights became the most important goal for black and white reformers in the United States. Most of the civil rights became law in 1964 and 1965. King got the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 for his role in the Civil Rights Movement. He was also named \u2018Person of the Year\u2019 by Time magazine. In March 1968 King went to Memphis, Tennessee. He wanted to support African-American workers there who were on strike 11 against bad working conditions. On April 4, 1968 he was shot. James Earl Ray, a white escaped convict 12 , was arrested and was sentenced 13 to 99 years in prison. Since 1983 the third Monday in January has become a national holiday 14 in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. The house where King was born and his grave in Atlanta are national monuments. Streets in towns and cities all over the United States have been named after him. King was the leader of the Civil Rights Movement for almost 13 years. During that time African Americans made a lot of progress on the way towards equality 15 in America. However, many black Americans still experience racial discrimination today. King is known as one of the greatest non-violent leaders in world history. ___ 1 minister [\u02c8m\u026an\u026ast\u0259] \u2212 Pfarrer, Pfarrerin ; 2 civil rights [\u02ccs\u026avl \u02c8ra\u026ats] \u2212 B\u00fcrgerrechte ; 3 segregated [\u02c8segr\u026age\u026at\u026ad] \u2212 getrennt (nach Hautfarbe) ; 4 campaign [k\u04d5\u02c8pe\u026an] \u2212 Kampagne, Aktion ; 5 illegal [\u026a\u02c8li:gl] \u2212 illegal, gesetzeswidrig ; 6 victory [\u02c8v\u026aktri] \u2212 Sieg ; 7 to achieve [\u0259\u02c8t\u222bi:v] \u2212 erreichen ; 8 access [\u02c8\u04d5kses] \u2212 Zugang, Zutritt ; 9 restroom [\u02c8rest\u02ccr\u028am] \u2212 Toilette ; 10 struggle [\u02c8str\u028cgl] \u2212 Kampf ; 11 to be on strike [\u0252n \u02c8stra\u026ak] \u2212 streiken ; 12 escaped convict [\u026a\u02ccske\u026apd \u02c8k\u0252nv\u026akt] \u2212 fl\u00fcchtiger Str\u00e4fling ; 13 to sentence [\u02c8sent\u0259ns] \u2212 verurteilen ; 14 national holiday [\u02ccn\u04d5\u222bnl \u02c8h\u0252l\u0259de\u026a] \u2212 (nationaler) Feiertag ; 15 equality [\u026a\u02c8kw\u0252l\u0259ti] \u2212 Gleichheit   What should I do?

Danny is the coolest guy in the world \u2013 and he\u2019s so cute. We\u2019ve been together since last April. I still go to school in Christchurch, but Danny left school two months ago. I thought he was only looking for a job in Christchurch. Then last week, while we were walking to the cinema, he told me that he got a job as an apprentice chef at a hotel in Wellington. He told me after he had already accepted the job. I was so upset! Danny said that there were no jobs here and he really needed one. We could video chat every day and he would come back to Christchurch whenever he could. But it takes a whole day to get to Wellington by train and ferry. That\u2019s too far! I really love Danny and I don\u2019t want to lose him. We belong together! I\u2019m thinking about leaving school and living with him in Wellington. Of course, my parents don\u2019t understand. We had a big argument and haven\u2019t really made up since. They just told me to concentrate on school. Please help me. I really need some advice. Clara RE: He didn\u2019t tell me. Linda ( online ) 16th June 2021, 8:55 Hello Clara, I understand how you feel. Danny means everything to you. You want to spend every minute with him. Now Danny made an important decision without discussing it with you first. That hurts, doesn\u2019t it? Maybe it\u2019s time to talk about what each of you really wants. Ask yourself: What do you want? What are you worried about? Is it really only because Wellington is so far away, or don\u2019t you trust your boyfriend? Are you afraid that he will cheat on you? How would you feel about breaking up? Whatever you do, don\u2019t make decisions now that you may not be happy about later. If you want to stay together, you could stay with Danny during the school holidays for a start. That might be OK for your parents. You could still move in with him later, after you\u2019ve finished school. Good luck! Linda"}

Luke went home and phoned the bus company. They wanted to help but first they needed a special number from his phone \u2013 and he didn\u2019t know the number! Luke didn\u2019t enjoy his dinner at all that night. Why wasn\u2019t he more careful with his phone? Suddenly the doorbell rang. \u201cGwen\u2019s here!\u201d shouted Luke\u2019s mum from the hall. Luke went to the door. Gwen and her dad were there. \u201cI heard something fall on the floor when you got off the bus,\u201d said Gwen. \u201cI asked a woman to see what it was.\u201d Gwen gave Luke his phone. \u201cWow!\u201d said Luke. \u201cToday is my lucky day!

(A girl and an old woman are at a bus stop in the village. The girl has a bag. She has money in her hands.) Dora One, two, three, four pounds fifty. Yes! I have enough money for the bus to London. Old woman Why do young people always want to go to London? It\u2019s dirty and not safe. Dora That\u2019s not true. It\u2019s the most amazing city in the world.

The lights go down 3 .) Narrator When Dora arrives in London, she gets a job. (Dora is in a busy restaurant kitchen. She is doing the washing up 4 . A chef and a waiter are in the kitchen. There are dirty plates, glasses and pots next to Dora.) Waiter I need six plates and glasses now! Dora One moment, please. Chef Work faster. I need three clean pots now. Dora Yes, chef. Chef Where are they? I need them now! Dora You can have them in a minute. I\u2019m busy with these plates. (Dora gives the plates to the waiter.) Waiter These plates are dirty! Dora I\u2019m sorry!

Narrator Dora\u2019s life in London isn\u2019t like it was in her dreams. (Dora is at a London bus stop with her bag. She looks very sad.) Dora Maybe London isn\u2019t the place for me. (Dora sees a leaflet on the road. She takes it and looks at it.) (She reads from the leaflet.) Three Lions Hotel. We need kitchen workers for our very special restaurant. We are a friendly restaurant, but you must be hard-working and determined. (Dora smiles and stands up straight. There is the sound of a bus.) Bus driver (From off the stage 6 , on the left) Do you want to get on? This is the last bus to Aldham today. Dora No thanks. I want to stay here. London is the place for me. (A young woman walks past Dora.) Dora Excuse me. Can you tell me the way to the Three Lions Hotel, please? Young woman The Three Lions Hotel? Yes, of course. Go straight on. It\u2019s on the right.

I want to be with my friends. But I\u2019m not. Mum and Dad sent me to stay with Aunt Susan for six long days. To a village! In the middle of nowhere. All you can see are fields, trees and some animals. There are no shops, no caf\u00e9s and no buses. No skate park either! It\u2019s so boring! How can people live here? There was a party in the village this evening. But it wasn\u2019t fun. There was a barbecue 1 and then singing and dancing. But the music was awful. I was so bored that I turned their music off and played some hip-hop 2 instead. Everybody was mad and shouted at me. I laughed at them and left. I hate this place and I hate these people. How can birds be so loud? Some of them started singing at four in the morning! Later the church bells 3 rang 4 . Nothing happened today. Just another boring day. When can I go home? Nothing! Aunt Susan wanted me to help with the cows and in the garden, but I stayed in my room and watched films. The village boys tried to pick me up for a football game. I told them that I didn\u2019t have my football shoes and couldn\u2019t play. I can\u2019t believe what happened last night. I woke up in the middle of the night because there was a loud noise in the house. I went to the kitchen and saw Aunt Susan there. She was on the phone, and she was very excited. When she saw me, she told me to come with her. Rosalie needed help. I didn\u2019t know who Rosalie was. I was surprised when I saw that Rosalie was one of Aunt Susan\u2019s cows. She needed help with her calf. Some other people from the village were there too. They were all very calm and knew what to do. They told me to hold the light so that the vet could see well. I could hardly look. That noise! And it smelt terrible. Yuck! 5 Then it was there. A little calf. So sweet, so clumsy. We all felt very happy. I was so tired but so excited. I got up early again. I just had to see if the calf was OK. It was. It stood next to Rosalie and drank its milk. It\u2019s the most beautiful little cow I\u2019ve ever seen 6 . I think I\u2019ll ask Aunt Susan if I can come back again. I think it\u2019s not that bad here. ___ 1 barbecue \u2013 Grillparty ; 2 hip-hop \u2013 Hip Hop (Musikrichtung) ; 3 bell \u2013 die Glocke ; 4 ring \u2013 l\u00e4uten ; 5 yuck \u2013 igitt 6 the most beautiful cow I\u2019ve ever seen \u2013 die sch\u00f6nste Kuh, die ich je gesehen habe"}

Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy \u2013 after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world\u2019s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren\u2019t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is \u2018fracking\u2019, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, \u201cFracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.\u201d But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada\u2019s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the end of this yet,\u201d says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. \u201cCO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.\u201d 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven\u2019t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won\u2019t change. \u201cWhat worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.\u201d Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable \u2013 which means that when we have used them up, there simply won\u2019t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada\u2019s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better \u2013 and we will have to.   The sound of ice I\u2019m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn\u2019t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship\u2019s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the \u2018northwest passage\u2019, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn\u2019t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship\u2019s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It\u2019s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn\u2019t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we\u2019d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn\u2019t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn\u2019t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back\u2019s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can\u2019t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let\u2019s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I\u2019m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown.

(a.lal@vii.com) My name is Emma De Santis. I\u2019m from Germany and I\u2019m 18 years old. I took part in a project at an orphanage in Jaipur last year. My English isn\u2019t bad and I used to work as a babysitter for our neighbours\u2019 kids. I could choose to work from four weeks to ten months. I decided to stay for eight weeks. Before I went to India, I had to get all the important papers. I also knew that I would have to pay the organization almost \u20ac2,000. The flight was not included. So I decided to work in a supermarket to earn the money. When I got the contract for the project in India, I booked my flight and I was ready to go. When I arrived in Jaipur, I was very tired from the journey and the time difference. The heat, the noise and the smells made it even worse. But I still remember a cow lying in front of the phone shop. During the orientation days I met other volunteers from different countries, which was great. After that I met my host family. They were very friendly people. However, I was homesick during the first days, and I had some problems with the food. It was so spicy. At the time I thought, \u201cIf I don\u2019t feel better soon, I\u2019ll have to quit.\u201d But I got over it quickly. My job was great but challenging too. The working conditions were OK. I was teaching 10-year-old girls English and organizing some free-time activities for the younger ones. The staff were very helpful. They all spoke English, which made things a little easier. I quickly found out that things are different in India. Most people\u2019s attitude in India is \u201cWhatever happens, happens.\u201d And usually that\u2019s OK for everyone. Wherever I went, people were smiling at me. But they didn\u2019t just show interest in me, many of them actually stared at me. But you learn to ignore it. I can really recommend taking part in a project like this. I met wonderful people, made new friends and learned a lot about myself. If you go to India, you\u2019ll never forget it.   \u2018I have a dream\u2019 - Martin Luther King, Jr. On April 4, 1968 the African-American minister 1 and US civil rights 2 leader Martin Luther King, Junior was shot in Memphis, Tennessee. The week after his death there were violent protests in cities across the United States. But who was this man whose death shook both a nation and also people around the rest of the world? King was born in the American South, in Atlanta, Georgia, on January 15, 1929. He grew up in a religious family. His father was a Baptist pastor and his mother was a church organist. At that time the people in the American South were segregated 3 . Laws made sure that in the Southern states African-American people did not have the same rights as whites. They had to go to different schools and eat in different restaurants. They weren\u2019t allowed to work with white people. African Americans had to sit at the back of buses and give up their seats to white people. King never wanted to accept this segregation. When he was little, his best friend was a white boy. King, however, had to go to a school for African Americans, while his friend went to a school for whites. So King lost his friend. Over the years King realized how unfair his family and neighbors were treated. He wanted to fight for the civil rights of African Americans. At the age of 18 King decided to become a minister. He felt that the church could give him the best chance to help people and society. He finished college in 1951. He got married to his girlfriend Coretta Scott in 1953, and together they had four children. A year later he became pastor of a Baptist church in Montgomery, Alabama. Protests against racial segregation began in 1955. African-American Rosa Parks hadn\u2019t wanted to give up her bus seat to white people in the city of Montgomery. Rosa Parks was arrested. King started a campaign 4 . For 381 days people didn\u2019t use the city\u2019s public transportation. The campaign was led by Martin Luther King, Jr. During this time his house was bombed and he was arrested too. In the end racial segregation on all Montgomery public transportation was made illegal 5 . It was the first victory 6 for the Civil Rights Movement and it made King a very famous person. In 1957 King and other civil rights activists founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). They wanted to use non-violent protests to achieve 7 civil rights reform. King was influenced by Mahatma Gandhi and his successful non-violent protest against the British Empire in the 1940s. The SCLC started a campaign against racial segregation in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963. Everything was peaceful until the police used water cannons and police dogs against the protesters, even against children. When this was shown on national TV, many white Americans were shocked. The Birmingham campaign was successful and African Americans now had more access 8 to public places. \u2018White Only\u2019 and \u2018Black Only\u2019 signs were removed from restrooms 9 , for example. Early in the Birmingham campaign, King had been arrested again. In his cell he realized that freedom for African-American people would be a long and hard struggle 10 . Later that year King helped organize the March on Washington on August 28, 1963. Its goal was to protest against the way African Americans were treated in Southern states. The protesters wanted an end to racial segregation in schools and at work. They also wanted to protect workers from police brutality. More than 250,000 people joined the march. At the time it was the largest meeting of protesters in the history of Washington, D.C. During this event King gave his most famous speech \u2013 \u2018I have a dream\u2019. It became one of the greatest American speeches. Soon after, civil rights became the most important goal for black and white reformers in the United States. Most of the civil rights became law in 1964 and 1965. King got the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 for his role in the Civil Rights Movement. He was also named \u2018Person of the Year\u2019 by Time magazine. In March 1968 King went to Memphis, Tennessee. He wanted to support African-American workers there who were on strike 11 against bad working conditions. On April 4, 1968 he was shot. James Earl Ray, a white escaped convict 12 , was arrested and was sentenced 13 to 99 years in prison. Since 1983 the third Monday in January has become a national holiday 14 in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. The house where King was born and his grave in Atlanta are national monuments. Streets in towns and cities all over the United States have been named after him. King was the leader of the Civil Rights Movement for almost 13 years. During that time African Americans made a lot of progress on the way towards equality 15 in America. However, many black Americans still experience racial discrimination today. King is known as one of the greatest non-violent leaders in world history. ___ 1 minister [\u02c8m\u026an\u026ast\u0259] \u2212 Pfarrer, Pfarrerin ; 2 civil rights [\u02ccs\u026avl \u02c8ra\u026ats] \u2212 B\u00fcrgerrechte ; 3 segregated [\u02c8segr\u026age\u026at\u026ad] \u2212 getrennt (nach Hautfarbe) ; 4 campaign [k\u04d5\u02c8pe\u026an] \u2212 Kampagne, Aktion ; 5 illegal [\u026a\u02c8li:gl] \u2212 illegal, gesetzeswidrig ; 6 victory [\u02c8v\u026aktri] \u2212 Sieg ; 7 to achieve [\u0259\u02c8t\u222bi:v] \u2212 erreichen ; 8 access [\u02c8\u04d5kses] \u2212 Zugang, Zutritt ; 9 restroom [\u02c8rest\u02ccr\u028am] \u2212 Toilette ; 10 struggle [\u02c8str\u028cgl] \u2212 Kampf ; 11 to be on strike [\u0252n \u02c8stra\u026ak] \u2212 streiken ; 12 escaped convict [\u026a\u02ccske\u026apd \u02c8k\u0252nv\u026akt] \u2212 fl\u00fcchtiger Str\u00e4fling ; 13 to sentence [\u02c8sent\u0259ns] \u2212 verurteilen ; 14 national holiday [\u02ccn\u04d5\u222bnl \u02c8h\u0252l\u0259de\u026a] \u2212 (nationaler) Feiertag ; 15 equality [\u026a\u02c8kw\u0252l\u0259ti] \u2212 Gleichheit   What should I do? He didn\u2019t tell me. Clara ( online ) 15th June 2021, 19:17 Hi Linda, I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m 17 and my boyfriend, Danny, is 19. Danny is the coolest guy in the world \u2013 and he\u2019s so cute. We\u2019ve been together since last April. I still go to school in Christchurch, but Danny left school two months ago. I thought he was only looking for a job in Christchurch. Then last week, while we were walking to the cinema, he told me that he got a job as an apprentice chef at a hotel in Wellington. He told me after he had already accepted the job. I was so upset! Danny said that there were no jobs here and he really needed one. We could video chat every day and he would come back to Christchurch whenever he could. But it takes a whole day to get to Wellington by train and ferry. That\u2019s too far! I really love Danny and I don\u2019t want to lose him. We belong together! I\u2019m thinking about leaving school and living with him in Wellington. Of course, my parents don\u2019t understand. We had a big argument and haven\u2019t really made up since. They just told me to concentrate on school. Please help me. I really need some advice. Clara RE: He didn\u2019t tell me. Linda ( online ) 16th June 2021, 8:55 Hello Clara, I understand how you feel. Danny means everything to you. You want to spend every minute with him. Now Danny made an important decision without discussing it with you first. That hurts, doesn\u2019t it? Maybe it\u2019s time to talk about what each of you really wants. Ask yourself: What do you want? What are you worried about? Is it really only because Wellington is so far away, or don\u2019t you trust your boyfriend? Are you afraid that he will cheat on you? How would you feel about breaking up? Whatever you do, don\u2019t make decisions now that you may not be happy about later. If you want to stay together, you could stay with Danny during the school holidays for a start. That might be OK for your parents. You could still move in with him later, after you\u2019ve finished school. Good luck! Linda"}

I thought it was a magical city with a very special atmosphere. It\u2019s small enough to get around easily and not feel lost, but big enough that there\u2019s a lot to do. So after I left school, I decided to go to university there. It was a good decision \u2013 I had a wonderful time! The locals were really friendly and after some time I even started to understand the Edinburgh accent. In fact, I loved Edinburgh so much that I stayed after university. At first I lived and worked in the city, but after I met my husband (who is a true Scotsman!) we moved to the countryside nearby. I work from home now as I have my own business. But I love to drive to the city at the weekend in my Mini. Last week my parents came to stay and we visited Edinburgh Castle and the Scottish National Gallery. One day we took the children to the zoo, and another day we took a boat out to Inchcolm Abbey on a nearby island. Most days we had a picnic lunch in the Princes Street Gardens.I love that there are so many different things to do in Edinburgh. This city really has become my home now.

The Body In \u201cThe Body\u201d, Gordie Lachance and his three friends learn that a boy from their area, in the state of Maine, has disappeared and is probably dead. They decide to go on a trip to find the boy\u2019s body and prepare for the trip. The Gun My room was on the second floor, and it was really hot up there. I was glad I wasn\u2019t sleeping there that night, and the thought of where we were going made me excited again. I rolled up two blankets and tied an old belt around them. I grabbed all my money, which was less than a dollar. Then I was ready to go. I went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad. I was walking up Carbine Street towards the clubhouse when Chris caught up with me. His eyes were shining. \u201cGordie! You want to see something?\u201d \u201cSure. What?\u201d \u201cCome down here first.\u201d He pointed down an alley between two shops. \u201cWhat is it, Chris?\u201d \u201cCome on, I said!\u201d He ran down the alley and I ran after him. At the bottom, the smell from the trash was terrible. \u201cChris, I\u2019m going to puke, I\u2019m \u2013 \u201d But I forgot about the smell when Chris put his hand into his backpack and pulled out a big gun. \u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d \u201cFrom my dad\u2019s desk.\u201d \u201cMan, your dad\u2019s going to beat you when he finds out.\u201d Chris\u2019s eyes just went on dancing. \u201cHe isn\u2019t going to find out. He and his friends have got enough wine to keep them drunk for a week. I\u2019ll put it back before then.\u201d Chris hated alcohol \u2013 he\u2019d already seen too much of what it can do. He was the only one of us who didn\u2019t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they\u2019d stolen from their father. \u201cHave you got bullets for it?\u201d \u201cNine of them \u2013 all that was left in the box. He\u2019ll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.\u201d \u201cAny in it at the moment?\u201d \u201cNo, of course not. What do you think I am?\u201d I finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA \u2013 BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin \u2013 it was the work of an evil magician. \u201cWow!\u201d I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn\u2019t tell if he was amused or scared. \u201cYou did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!\u201d \u201cShut up! Let\u2019s go!\u201d I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. \u201cMan, it\u2019s a pity you couldn\u2019t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.\u201d \u201cYou knew there was a bullet in it, didn\u2019t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad\u2019s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.\u201d Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, \u201cWhat do you think we need a gun for?\u201d \u201cNothing, really,\u201d Chris said. \u201cExcept we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it\u2019s frightening out in the forest at night.\u201d Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?\u201d Teddy asked Vern. \u201cYeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it\u2019ll look as if we\u2019re there after dark.\u201d \u201cHey, man, great!\u201d I said, and slapped Vern on the back. For him, that was real thinking. He grinned. \u201cSo let\u2019s go,\u201d Teddy said. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly twelve already.\u201d Chris stood up and we gathered round him. \u201cWe\u2019ll walk across Beeman\u2019s field,\u201d he said, \u201cand then we\u2019ll get to the railway tracks and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.\u201d \u201cHow far is it, do you think?\u201d Teddy asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Chris. \u201cHarlow\u2019s big. We\u2019re going to have to walk at least twenty miles. Does that sound right to you, Gordie?\u201d \u201cYeah. Maybe more \u2013 thirty miles.\u201d \u201cCome on, you guys,\u201d Chris said, and picked up his backpack, blankets and water bottle.   Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? headline written by Pam Warner (published 07\/12\/16 in Health & Style ) author, date, source What is your Thanksgiving like? Turkey and pumpkin pie? American football on the sofa? In the last couple of years a new trend has become popular in the USA: More people like to eat better quality food and live a more active life. introduction It is slowly going out of fashion to live off convenience and frozen food. A number of people shop for organic food at special supermarkets instead. In some states farmers\u2019 markets offer a great variety of fresh vegetables and fruit from the region. \u201cThere are also dairy products, bread and meat without chemical additives at these markets. Organic food is not only much healthier but it tastes a lot better as well,\u201d explains Emma from Boston. So how about some healthy recipes for Thanksgiving? Maybe pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes? A roast turkey breast or a turkey roulade filled with apples and cranberries is delicious too. But there\u2019s more to a healthy lifestyle than just food. A lot of trend sports show that you can have fun, spend time with friends and stay fit at the same time. Have you found the right sport for you yet? If not, here is a suggestion: How about standup paddleboarding? If you like water, that\u2019s the ideal kind of sport for you. You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: \u201cDrinking too much alcohol isn\u2019t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?\u201d Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don\u2019t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion"}

Water filled the ship until it sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD\u2019S LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship\u2019s builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. LOCAL MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland. The ship\u2019s doctor, Dr John Simpson, 37, was born in Belfast. His mother was optimistic when a letter from him arrived at her home yesterday. However, we have found out that he posted the letter during the ship\u2019s last stop. We now know that Dr Simpson did not survive. DOG SAVES LIVES Some were lucky and the ships which came to save the passengers of the Titanic found their lifeboat. According to a passenger, one of the dogs on board saved the lives of the people in one lifeboat. A ship only found this lifeboat in the dark night and the foggy weather because they heard the dog when it barked. HOW COULD IT HAPPEN? After the sinking of the Titanic a number of questions still need answers. Why did no one see the iceberg? Why did the ship break? Why were there only 20 lifeboats for 2,200 people on board? Why did lifeboats leave the ship when they were not yet full? And how can we make sure that an accident like this will never happen again? About 700 people survived the accident. Some ships today have over 6,500 passengers and crew. After the Titanic\u2019s accident there were laws that ships must have one lifeboat place for every person on board. Dr Simpson\u2019s last letter to his mother is now in the Belfast Titanic museum.   A deadly silence 1. My name is Jonas Fox and I\u2019m twelve years old. I work in the mines and my job is to sit near a door in the tunnel every day. I must open the door when the coal arrives. Then, after it\u2019s gone, I quickly close the door again. Every day I sit in the dark, but I\u2019m never scared. That\u2019s because my friend Billy is always there with me. Billy sings all day long. He\u2019s yellow with little black eyes which look like they are made of glass. Billy is a canary, you see? It\u2019s never boring with Billy around. I would love to sing too, but I can\u2019t even talk. 2. Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine killed 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there\u2019s gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine. One day Bart started to cough and he never stopped coughing after that. Then one night my brother coughed so badly that he died. That was when I stopped talking. I don\u2019t know why, really. I still had words in my head and I opened my mouth, but I couldn\u2019t speak. The men in the mine started to call me \u2018Silent Jonas\u2019 after that. They probably thought I was a bit strange. 4. The day when things got really bad started like any other. Billy was singing like he always did. I heard the people in the tunnels and the noise of the coal trucks. I opened the door and I felt a cold wind in the tunnel. I closed the door again. Billy stopped singing. For a moment I didn\u2019t understand. But then, suddenly, I did: There was gas in the mine! And it could explode any second. I didn\u2019t have time to run down the tunnel to warn the men. If only I could talk, if only I could shout! 5. I knew I had to warn everyone in the mine. So I opened my mouth and tried to say it: \u201cGas.\u201d But there was no sound. Nothing came out. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth again. Nothing. I panicked. We could die in here \u2013 I had to speak! I tried again. This time the sound was quiet, but I made a sound. At last! I opened the door and shouted, \u201cGas. Gas. GAS!\u201d A moment later I heard the sound of the miners\u2019 boots in the tunnels. I took Billy\u2019s cage and ran too. 6. I ran through the tunnel as fast as I could. But my head hurt and I couldn\u2019t breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn\u2019t tell where it was coming from. \u201cCome on, boy!\u201d it said. Somebody picked me up. I turned around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy\u2019s cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn\u2019t just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, \u201cWho warned us?\u201d \u201cMe!\u201d I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. \u201cSilent Jonas found his voice!\u201d a miner shouted. But how could I feel happy? My friend Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small \u2018Tweet\u2019. Billy was alive! I opened the cage \u2026 There were canaries in mines until 1987. Today miners use machines to find out if there is gas in the mine."}

(A girl and an old woman are at a bus stop in the village. The girl has a bag. She has money in her hands.) Dora One, two, three, four pounds fifty. Yes! I have enough money for the bus to London. Old woman Why do young people always want to go to London? It\u2019s dirty and not safe. Dora That\u2019s not true. It\u2019s the most amazing city in the world. And it\u2019s the place where dreams come true 1 . London is the place for me! Old woman I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s an awful place. (Dora looks down the road. There is the sound of a bus.)

The lights go down 3 .) Narrator When Dora arrives in London, she gets a job. (Dora is in a busy restaurant kitchen. She is doing the washing up 4 . A chef and a waiter are in the kitchen. There are dirty plates, glasses and pots next to Dora.) Waiter I need six plates and glasses now! Dora One moment, please. Chef Work faster. I need three clean pots now. Dora Yes, chef. Chef Where are they? I need them now! Dora You can have them in a minute. I\u2019m busy with these plates. (Dora gives the plates to the waiter.) Waiter These plates are dirty! Dora I\u2019m sorry!

Narrator Dora\u2019s life in London isn\u2019t like it was in her dreams. (Dora is at a London bus stop with her bag. She looks very sad.) Dora Maybe London isn\u2019t the place for me.

We are a friendly restaurant, but you must be hard-working and determined. (Dora smiles and stands up straight. There is the sound of a bus.) Bus driver (From off the stage 6 , on the left) Do you want to get on? This is the last bus to Aldham today. Dora No thanks. I want to stay here. London is the place for me.

I want to be with my friends. But I\u2019m not. Mum and Dad sent me to stay with Aunt Susan for six long days. To a village! In the middle of nowhere. All you can see are fields, trees and some animals. There are no shops, no caf\u00e9s and no buses. No skate park either! It\u2019s so boring! How can people live here? There was a party in the village this evening. But it wasn\u2019t fun. There was a barbecue 1 and then singing and dancing. But the music was awful. I was so bored that I turned their music off and played some hip-hop 2 instead. Everybody was mad and shouted at me. I laughed at them and left. I hate this place and I hate these people. How can birds be so loud? Some of them started singing at four in the morning! Later the church bells 3 rang 4 . Nothing happened today. Just another boring day. When can I go home? Nothing! Aunt Susan wanted me to help with the cows and in the garden, but I stayed in my room and watched films. The village boys tried to pick me up for a football game. I told them that I didn\u2019t have my football shoes and couldn\u2019t play. I can\u2019t believe what happened last night. I woke up in the middle of the night because there was a loud noise in the house. I went to the kitchen and saw Aunt Susan there. She was on the phone, and she was very excited. When she saw me, she told me to come with her. Rosalie needed help. I didn\u2019t know who Rosalie was. I was surprised when I saw that Rosalie was one of Aunt Susan\u2019s cows. She needed help with her calf. Some other people from the village were there too. They were all very calm and knew what to do. They told me to hold the light so that the vet could see well. I could hardly look. That noise! And it smelt terrible. Yuck! 5 Then it was there. A little calf. So sweet, so clumsy. We all felt very happy. I was so tired but so excited. I got up early again. I just had to see if the calf was OK. It was. It stood next to Rosalie and drank its milk. It\u2019s the most beautiful little cow I\u2019ve ever seen 6 .

Luke went home and phoned the bus company. They wanted to help but first they needed a special number from his phone \u2013 and he didn\u2019t know the number! Luke didn\u2019t enjoy his dinner at all that night. Why wasn\u2019t he more careful with his phone? Suddenly the doorbell rang. \u201cGwen\u2019s here!\u201d shouted Luke\u2019s mum from the hall. Luke went to the door. Gwen and her dad were there. \u201cI heard something fall on the floor when you got off the bus,\u201d said Gwen. \u201cI asked a woman to see what it was.\u201d Gwen gave Luke his phone. \u201cWow!\u201d said Luke. \u201cToday is my lucky day! Thanks, Gwen.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what friends are for!\u201d said Gwen. \u201cCome on, Gwen. Let\u2019s get that pizza!\u201d said Gwen\u2019s dad. Luke put his phone in his pocket. It really was his lucky day. Maybe he could get his best ever high score too.   How I won a prize The TV show \u2018Teen chef of the year\u2019 tries to find the UK\u2019s best young chef.

I want to be with my friends. But I\u2019m not. Mum and Dad sent me to stay with Aunt Susan for six long days. To a village! In the middle of nowhere. All you can see are fields, trees and some animals. There are no shops, no caf\u00e9s and no buses. No skate park either! It\u2019s so boring! How can people live here? There was a party in the village this evening. But it wasn\u2019t fun. There was a barbecue 1 and then singing and dancing. But the music was awful. I was so bored that I turned their music off and played some hip-hop 2 instead. Everybody was mad and shouted at me. I laughed at them and left. I hate this place and I hate these people. How can birds be so loud? Some of them started singing at four in the morning! Later the church bells 3 rang 4 . Nothing happened today. Just another boring day. When can I go home? Nothing! Aunt Susan wanted me to help with the cows and in the garden, but I stayed in my room and watched films. The village boys tried to pick me up for a football game. I told them that I didn\u2019t have my football shoes and couldn\u2019t play. I can\u2019t believe what happened last night. I woke up in the middle of the night because there was a loud noise in the house. I went to the kitchen and saw Aunt Susan there. She was on the phone, and she was very excited. When she saw me, she told me to come with her. Rosalie needed help. I didn\u2019t know who Rosalie was. I was surprised when I saw that Rosalie was one of Aunt Susan\u2019s cows. She needed help with her calf. Some other people from the village were there too. They were all very calm and knew what to do. They told me to hold the light so that the vet could see well. I could hardly look. That noise! And it smelt terrible. Yuck! 5 Then it was there. A little calf. So sweet, so clumsy. We all felt very happy. I was so tired but so excited. I got up early again. I just had to see if the calf was OK. It was. It stood next to Rosalie and drank its milk. It\u2019s the most beautiful little cow I\u2019ve ever seen 6 . I think I\u2019ll ask Aunt Susan if I can come back again. I think it\u2019s not that bad here. ___ 1 barbecue \u2013 Grillparty ; 2 hip-hop \u2013 Hip Hop (Musikrichtung) ; 3 bell \u2013 die Glocke ; 4 ring \u2013 l\u00e4uten ; 5 yuck \u2013 igitt 6 the most beautiful cow I\u2019ve ever seen \u2013 die sch\u00f6nste Kuh, die ich je gesehen habe"}

Water filled the ship until it sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD\u2019S LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship\u2019s builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. LOCAL MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland. The ship\u2019s doctor, Dr John Simpson, 37, was born in Belfast. His mother was optimistic when a letter from him arrived at her home yesterday. However, we have found out that he posted the letter during the ship\u2019s last stop. We now know that Dr Simpson did not survive. DOG SAVES LIVES Some were lucky and the ships which came to save the passengers of the Titanic found their lifeboat. According to a passenger, one of the dogs on board saved the lives of the people in one lifeboat. A ship only found this lifeboat in the dark night and the foggy weather because they heard the dog when it barked. HOW COULD IT HAPPEN? After the sinking of the Titanic a number of questions still need answers. Why did no one see the iceberg? Why did the ship break? Why were there only 20 lifeboats for 2,200 people on board? Why did lifeboats leave the ship when they were not yet full? And how can we make sure that an accident like this will never happen again? About 700 people survived the accident. Some ships today have over 6,500 passengers and crew. After the Titanic\u2019s accident there were laws that ships must have one lifeboat place for every person on board. Dr Simpson\u2019s last letter to his mother is now in the Belfast Titanic museum.   A deadly silence 1. My name is Jonas Fox and I\u2019m twelve years old. I work in the mines and my job is to sit near a door in the tunnel every day. I must open the door when the coal arrives. Then, after it\u2019s gone, I quickly close the door again. Every day I sit in the dark, but I\u2019m never scared. That\u2019s because my friend Billy is always there with me. Billy sings all day long. He\u2019s yellow with little black eyes which look like they are made of glass. Billy is a canary, you see? It\u2019s never boring with Billy around. I would love to sing too, but I can\u2019t even talk. 2. Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine killed 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there\u2019s gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine. One day Bart started to cough and he never stopped coughing after that. Then one night my brother coughed so badly that he died. That was when I stopped talking. I don\u2019t know why, really. I still had words in my head and I opened my mouth, but I couldn\u2019t speak. The men in the mine started to call me \u2018Silent Jonas\u2019 after that. They probably thought I was a bit strange. 4. The day when things got really bad started like any other. Billy was singing like he always did. I heard the people in the tunnels and the noise of the coal trucks. I opened the door and I felt a cold wind in the tunnel. I closed the door again. Billy stopped singing. For a moment I didn\u2019t understand. But then, suddenly, I did: There was gas in the mine! And it could explode any second. I didn\u2019t have time to run down the tunnel to warn the men. If only I could talk, if only I could shout! 5. I knew I had to warn everyone in the mine. So I opened my mouth and tried to say it: \u201cGas.\u201d But there was no sound. Nothing came out. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth again. Nothing. I panicked. We could die in here \u2013 I had to speak! I tried again. This time the sound was quiet, but I made a sound. At last! I opened the door and shouted, \u201cGas. Gas. GAS!\u201d A moment later I heard the sound of the miners\u2019 boots in the tunnels. I took Billy\u2019s cage and ran too. 6. I ran through the tunnel as fast as I could. But my head hurt and I couldn\u2019t breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn\u2019t tell where it was coming from. \u201cCome on, boy!\u201d it said. Somebody picked me up. I turned around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy\u2019s cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn\u2019t just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, \u201cWho warned us?\u201d \u201cMe!\u201d I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. \u201cSilent Jonas found his voice!\u201d a miner shouted. But how could I feel happy? My friend Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small \u2018Tweet\u2019. Billy was alive! I opened the cage \u2026 There were canaries in mines until 1987. Today miners use machines to find out if there is gas in the mine."}

Help: play with Jonas | nice boy - never speak | sing every day | then one day \u2026    The Titanic disaster The Belfast News Wednesday, 17th April 1912 TWO DAYS AFTER \u2013 MORE FACTS The giant ship Titanic, which was built here in Belfast\u2019s shipyard, hit an iceberg on 14th April, shortly before midnight. Water filled the ship until it sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD\u2019S LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship\u2019s builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. LOCAL MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland. The ship\u2019s doctor, Dr John Simpson, 37, was born in Belfast. His mother was optimistic when a letter from him arrived at her home yesterday. However, we have found out that he posted the letter during the ship\u2019s last stop. We now know that Dr Simpson did not survive. DOG SAVES LIVES Some were lucky and the ships which came to save the passengers of the Titanic found their lifeboat. According to a passenger, one of the dogs on board saved the lives of the people in one lifeboat. A ship only found this lifeboat in the dark night and the foggy weather because they heard the dog when it barked. HOW COULD IT HAPPEN? After the sinking of the Titanic a number of questions still need answers. Why did no one see the iceberg? Why did the ship break? Why were there only 20 lifeboats for 2,200 people on board? Why did lifeboats leave the ship when they were not yet full? And how can we make sure that an accident like this will never happen again? About 700 people survived the accident. Some ships today have over 6,500 passengers and crew. After the Titanic\u2019s accident there were laws that ships must have one lifeboat place for every person on board. Dr Simpson\u2019s last letter to his mother is now in the Belfast Titanic museum.   A deadly silence 1. My name is Jonas Fox and I\u2019m twelve years old. I work in the mines and my job is to sit near a door in the tunnel every day. I must open the door when the coal arrives. Then, after it\u2019s gone, I quickly close the door again. Every day I sit in the dark, but I\u2019m never scared. That\u2019s because my friend Billy is always there with me. Billy sings all day long. He\u2019s yellow with little black eyes which look like they are made of glass. Billy is a canary, you see? It\u2019s never boring with Billy around. I would love to sing too, but I can\u2019t even talk. 2. Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine killed 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there\u2019s gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine. One day Bart started to cough and he never stopped coughing after that. Then one night my brother coughed so badly that he died. That was when I stopped talking. I don\u2019t know why, really. I still had words in my head and I opened my mouth, but I couldn\u2019t speak. The men in the mine started to call me \u2018Silent Jonas\u2019 after that. They probably thought I was a bit strange. 4. The day when things got really bad started like any other. Billy was singing like he always did. I heard the people in the tunnels and the noise of the coal trucks. I opened the door and I felt a cold wind in the tunnel. I closed the door again. Billy stopped singing. For a moment I didn\u2019t understand. But then, suddenly, I did: There was gas in the mine! And it could explode any second. I didn\u2019t have time to run down the tunnel to warn the men. If only I could talk, if only I could shout! 5. I knew I had to warn everyone in the mine. So I opened my mouth and tried to say it: \u201cGas.\u201d But there was no sound. Nothing came out. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth again. Nothing. I panicked. We could die in here \u2013 I had to speak! I tried again. This time the sound was quiet, but I made a sound. At last! I opened the door and shouted, \u201cGas. Gas. GAS!\u201d A moment later I heard the sound of the miners\u2019 boots in the tunnels. I took Billy\u2019s cage and ran too. 6. I ran through the tunnel as fast as I could. But my head hurt and I couldn\u2019t breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn\u2019t tell where it was coming from. \u201cCome on, boy!\u201d it said. Somebody picked me up. I turned around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy\u2019s cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn\u2019t just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, \u201cWho warned us?\u201d \u201cMe!\u201d I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open.

I want to be with my friends. But I\u2019m not. Mum and Dad sent me to stay with Aunt Susan for six long days. To a village! In the middle of nowhere. All you can see are fields, trees and some animals. There are no shops, no caf\u00e9s and no buses. No skate park either! It\u2019s so boring! How can people live here? There was a party in the village this evening. But it wasn\u2019t fun. There was a barbecue 1 and then singing and dancing. But the music was awful. I was so bored that I turned their music off and played some hip-hop 2 instead. Everybody was mad and shouted at me. I laughed at them and left. I hate this place and I hate these people. How can birds be so loud? Some of them started singing at four in the morning! Later the church bells 3 rang 4 . Nothing happened today. Just another boring day. When can I go home? Nothing! Aunt Susan wanted me to help with the cows and in the garden, but I stayed in my room and watched films. The village boys tried to pick me up for a football game. I told them that I didn\u2019t have my football shoes and couldn\u2019t play. I can\u2019t believe what happened last night. I woke up in the middle of the night because there was a loud noise in the house. I went to the kitchen and saw Aunt Susan there. She was on the phone, and she was very excited. When she saw me, she told me to come with her. Rosalie needed help. I didn\u2019t know who Rosalie was. I was surprised when I saw that Rosalie was one of Aunt Susan\u2019s cows. She needed help with her calf. Some other people from the village were there too. They were all very calm and knew what to do. They told me to hold the light so that the vet could see well. I could hardly look. That noise! And it smelt terrible. Yuck! 5 Then it was there. A little calf. So sweet, so clumsy. We all felt very happy. I was so tired but so excited. I got up early again. I just had to see if the calf was OK. It was. It stood next to Rosalie and drank its milk. It\u2019s the most beautiful little cow I\u2019ve ever seen 6 .

Ambedkar, former Indian Minister of Law and Justice   The House on Mango Street My name In English my name means hope. In Spanish it means too many letters. It means sadness, it means waiting. It is like the number nine. A muddy color. It is the Mexican records my father plays on Sunday mornings when he is shaving, songs like sobbing. It was my great-grandmother\u2019s name and now it is mine. She was a horse woman too, born like me in the Chinese year of the horse \u2013 which is supposed 1 to be bad luck if you\u2019re born female \u2013 but I think this is a Chinese lie because the Chinese, like the Mexicans, don\u2019t like their women strong. My great-grandmother. I would\u2019ve liked to have known her, a wild horse of a woman, so wild she wouldn\u2019t marry. Until my great-grandfather threw a sack over her head and carried her off. Just like that, as if she were a fancy chandelier 2 . That\u2019s the way he did it. And the story goes she never forgave him. She looked out the window her whole life, the way so many women sit their sadness on an elbow. I wonder if she made the best with what she got or was she sorry because she couldn\u2019t be all the things she wanted to be. Esperanza. I have inherited her name, but I don\u2019t want to inherit her place by the window. At school they say my name funny as if the syllables were made out of tin and hurt the roof of your mouth. But in Spanish my name is made out of a softer something, like silver, not quite as thick as my sister\u2019s name \u2013 Magdalena \u2013 which is uglier than mine. Magdalena who at least can come home and become Nenny. But I am always Esperanza. I would like to baptize 3 myself under a new name, a name more like the real me, the one nobody sees. Esperanza as Lisandra or Maritza or Zeze the X. Yes. Something like Zeze the X will do. ___ From: Sandra Cisneros, The House on Mango Street , 2009 1 to suppose to believe; 2 chandelier [\u02cc\u0283\u00e6nd\u0259\u02c8l\u026a\u0259] Kronleuchter ; 3 to baptize taufen"}

The Titanic disaster The Belfast News Wednesday, 17th April 1912 TWO DAYS AFTER \u2013 MORE FACTS The giant ship Titanic, which was built here in Belfast\u2019s shipyard, hit an iceberg on 14th April, shortly before midnight. Water filled the ship until it sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD\u2019S LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship\u2019s builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. LOCAL MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland. The ship\u2019s doctor, Dr John Simpson, 37, was born in Belfast. His mother was optimistic when a letter from him arrived at her home yesterday. However, we have found out that he posted the letter during the ship\u2019s last stop. We now know that Dr Simpson did not survive. DOG SAVES LIVES Some were lucky and the ships which came to save the passengers of the Titanic found their lifeboat. According to a passenger, one of the dogs on board saved the lives of the people in one lifeboat. A ship only found this lifeboat in the dark night and the foggy weather because they heard the dog when it barked. HOW COULD IT HAPPEN? After the sinking of the Titanic a number of questions still need answers. Why did no one see the iceberg? Why did the ship break? Why were there only 20 lifeboats for 2,200 people on board? Why did lifeboats leave the ship when they were not yet full? And how can we make sure that an accident like this will never happen again? About 700 people survived the accident. Some ships today have over 6,500 passengers and crew. After the Titanic\u2019s accident there were laws that ships must have one lifeboat place for every person on board. Dr Simpson\u2019s last letter to his mother is now in the Belfast Titanic museum.   A deadly silence 1. My name is Jonas Fox and I\u2019m twelve years old. I work in the mines and my job is to sit near a door in the tunnel every day. I must open the door when the coal arrives. Then, after it\u2019s gone, I quickly close the door again. Every day I sit in the dark, but I\u2019m never scared. That\u2019s because my friend Billy is always there with me. Billy sings all day long. He\u2019s yellow with little black eyes which look like they are made of glass. Billy is a canary, you see? It\u2019s never boring with Billy around. I would love to sing too, but I can\u2019t even talk. 2. Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine killed 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there\u2019s gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine. One day Bart started to cough and he never stopped coughing after that. Then one night my brother coughed so badly that he died. That was when I stopped talking. I don\u2019t know why, really. I still had words in my head and I opened my mouth, but I couldn\u2019t speak. The men in the mine started to call me \u2018Silent Jonas\u2019 after that. They probably thought I was a bit strange. 4. The day when things got really bad started like any other. Billy was singing like he always did. I heard the people in the tunnels and the noise of the coal trucks. I opened the door and I felt a cold wind in the tunnel. I closed the door again. Billy stopped singing. For a moment I didn\u2019t understand. But then, suddenly, I did: There was gas in the mine! And it could explode any second. I didn\u2019t have time to run down the tunnel to warn the men. If only I could talk, if only I could shout! 5. I knew I had to warn everyone in the mine. So I opened my mouth and tried to say it: \u201cGas.\u201d But there was no sound. Nothing came out. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth again. Nothing. I panicked. We could die in here \u2013 I had to speak! I tried again. This time the sound was quiet, but I made a sound. At last! I opened the door and shouted, \u201cGas. Gas. GAS!\u201d A moment later I heard the sound of the miners\u2019 boots in the tunnels. I took Billy\u2019s cage and ran too. 6. I ran through the tunnel as fast as I could. But my head hurt and I couldn\u2019t breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn\u2019t tell where it was coming from. \u201cCome on, boy!\u201d it said. Somebody picked me up. I turned around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy\u2019s cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn\u2019t just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, \u201cWho warned us?\u201d \u201cMe!\u201d I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. \u201cSilent Jonas found his voice!\u201d a miner shouted. But how could I feel happy? My friend Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small \u2018Tweet\u2019. Billy was alive! I opened the cage \u2026 There were canaries in mines until 1987. Today miners use machines to find out if there is gas in the mine.   The Norman conquest The old king of England, Edward, died in 1066. He had no children and both his Anglo-Saxon brother-in-law, Harold, and his French cousin, William, Duke of Normandy, wanted to be the next king of England. Harold made himself king, and William was very angry. So what did he do next? He sailed to England with his army \u2026 Harold and William fought the battle on Senlac Hill, near Hastings. William\u2019s men were knights and they were better trained. They fought on horses and were good archers. Harold\u2019s men fought on foot and they were already tired from an earlier battle at Stamford Bridge, 200 miles away in the north of England. (Yes, they had to walk those 200 miles!) How do we know what happened during the Battle of Hastings? Well, we have the 70-metre long Bayeux Tapestry to tell us! The tapestry is like a comic and it tells the story of the battle. It tells us that Harold died when he got an arrow in his eye, but we don\u2019t know if this really happened. William won the Battle of Hastings and he became king of England on Christmas Day 1066. Today we know him as William the Conqueror. He was a big castle fan and built lots of them in England, including part of the Tower of London. He also took land from the Anglo-Saxons and gave it to his Norman friends. Did the Normans change England? Yes, of course they did! For example, they brought many new words to the English language. Words like \u2018pork\u2019 and \u2018garden\u2019 come from this time. Guess what? There are still many English people who have Norman surnames, like Archer or Darcy. Before the Normans came to England, most people didn\u2019t even have surnames. They lived in small villages, so a first name or a nickname was often enough. ___ conquest \u2013 Eroberung ; the Anglo-Saxons \u2013 die Angelsachsen (das Volk, das schon vor 1066 in England lebte) ; brother-in-law \u2013 Schwager ; duke \u2013 Herzog ; army \u2013 Heer; Armee ; knight \u2013 Ritter ; archer \u2013 Bogensch\u00fctze; Bogensch\u00fctzin ; tapestry \u2013 Wandteppich ; surname \u2013 Nachname; Familienname   The RNLI: Volunteers on the coast The RNLI is the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. It\u2019s a charity and it saves lives at sea. The RNLI has 237 lifeboat stations and about 4,600 crew members in the UK and Ireland. The RNLI rescues about 8,000 people per year. The RNLI has saved about 140,000 lives since 1824. Many of the lifeboat crew members are volunteers. The RNLI gets money from fundraising. 18th June 2016, by Simon Spade Yesterday the RNLI rescued two teenage boys who got into trouble when they were kayaking off the coast near Llandudno. The two 14-year-old boys went out too far in their kayaks and could not get back to the beach because of strong winds. They tried to get back for more than two and a half hours, then shouted for help and waved. A tourist spotted the boys and made an emergency call to the RNLI. The lifeboat crew left their station at 1:40 p.m. and got to the kayaks in only a few minutes. The RNLI crew picked up the boys and gave them blankets and hot drinks to keep them warm. Lifeboat helm Howard Link called the ambulance to meet them on the beach. Both boys were very weak and seasick. They both spent the night in Llandudno hospital but are back home now. The lifeboat crew got back to their station at 3:25 p.m. There are some rules to remember when you go to the beach: S pot the dangers. A lways go with a friend or adult.

Mention two things.","negative":"Look at the structure of the text We can do even better .   How does the author finish?    We can do even better \u2013 by Lindsay Fern (21\/1\/2017) 1. Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy \u2013 after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world\u2019s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren\u2019t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is \u2018fracking\u2019, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, \u201cFracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.\u201d But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada\u2019s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the end of this yet,\u201d says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. \u201cCO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.\u201d 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven\u2019t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won\u2019t change. \u201cWhat worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.\u201d Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable \u2013 which means that when we have used them up, there simply won\u2019t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada\u2019s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better \u2013 and we will have to."}

Chef Where are they? I need them now! Dora You can have them in a minute. I\u2019m busy with these plates. (Dora gives the plates to the waiter.) Waiter These plates are dirty! Dora I\u2019m sorry!

I want to be with my friends. But I\u2019m not. Mum and Dad sent me to stay with Aunt Susan for six long days. To a village! In the middle of nowhere. All you can see are fields, trees and some animals. There are no shops, no caf\u00e9s and no buses. No skate park either! It\u2019s so boring! How can people live here? There was a party in the village this evening. But it wasn\u2019t fun. There was a barbecue 1 and then singing and dancing. But the music was awful. I was so bored that I turned their music off and played some hip-hop 2 instead. Everybody was mad and shouted at me. I laughed at them and left. I hate this place and I hate these people. How can birds be so loud? Some of them started singing at four in the morning! Later the church bells 3 rang 4 . Nothing happened today. Just another boring day. When can I go home? Nothing! Aunt Susan wanted me to help with the cows and in the garden, but I stayed in my room and watched films. The village boys tried to pick me up for a football game. I told them that I didn\u2019t have my football shoes and couldn\u2019t play. I can\u2019t believe what happened last night. I woke up in the middle of the night because there was a loud noise in the house. I went to the kitchen and saw Aunt Susan there. She was on the phone, and she was very excited. When she saw me, she told me to come with her. Rosalie needed help. I didn\u2019t know who Rosalie was. I was surprised when I saw that Rosalie was one of Aunt Susan\u2019s cows. She needed help with her calf. Some other people from the village were there too. They were all very calm and knew what to do. They told me to hold the light so that the vet could see well. I could hardly look. That noise! And it smelt terrible. Yuck! 5 Then it was there. A little calf. So sweet, so clumsy. We all felt very happy. I was so tired but so excited. I got up early again. I just had to see if the calf was OK. It was. It stood next to Rosalie and drank its milk. It\u2019s the most beautiful little cow I\u2019ve ever seen 6 . I think I\u2019ll ask Aunt Susan if I can come back again.

As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness of either of them (for their days were long before the days of photographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like were unreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on my father's gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man with curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription, \"also Georgiana wife of the above,\" I drew a childish conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly.

They decide to go on a trip to find the boy\u2019s body and prepare for the trip. The Gun My room was on the second floor, and it was really hot up there. I was glad I wasn\u2019t sleeping there that night, and the thought of where we were going made me excited again. I rolled up two blankets and tied an old belt around them. I grabbed all my money, which was less than a dollar. Then I was ready to go. I went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad. I was walking up Carbine Street towards the clubhouse when Chris caught up with me. His eyes were shining. \u201cGordie! You want to see something?\u201d \u201cSure. What?\u201d \u201cCome down here first.\u201d He pointed down an alley between two shops. \u201cWhat is it, Chris?\u201d \u201cCome on, I said!\u201d He ran down the alley and I ran after him. At the bottom, the smell from the trash was terrible. \u201cChris, I\u2019m going to puke, I\u2019m \u2013 \u201d But I forgot about the smell when Chris put his hand into his backpack and pulled out a big gun. \u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d \u201cFrom my dad\u2019s desk.\u201d \u201cMan, your dad\u2019s going to beat you when he finds out.\u201d Chris\u2019s eyes just went on dancing. \u201cHe isn\u2019t going to find out. He and his friends have got enough wine to keep them drunk for a week. I\u2019ll put it back before then.\u201d Chris hated alcohol \u2013 he\u2019d already seen too much of what it can do. He was the only one of us who didn\u2019t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they\u2019d stolen from their father. \u201cHave you got bullets for it?\u201d \u201cNine of them \u2013 all that was left in the box. He\u2019ll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.\u201d \u201cAny in it at the moment?\u201d \u201cNo, of course not. What do you think I am?\u201d I finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA \u2013 BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin \u2013 it was the work of an evil magician. \u201cWow!\u201d I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn\u2019t tell if he was amused or scared. \u201cYou did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!\u201d \u201cShut up! Let\u2019s go!\u201d I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. \u201cMan, it\u2019s a pity you couldn\u2019t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.\u201d \u201cYou knew there was a bullet in it, didn\u2019t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad\u2019s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.\u201d Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, \u201cWhat do you think we need a gun for?\u201d \u201cNothing, really,\u201d Chris said. \u201cExcept we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it\u2019s frightening out in the forest at night.\u201d Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?\u201d Teddy asked Vern. \u201cYeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it\u2019ll look as if we\u2019re there after dark.\u201d \u201cHey, man, great!\u201d I said, and slapped Vern on the back. For him, that was real thinking. He grinned. \u201cSo let\u2019s go,\u201d Teddy said. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly twelve already.\u201d Chris stood up and we gathered round him. \u201cWe\u2019ll walk across Beeman\u2019s field,\u201d he said, \u201cand then we\u2019ll get to the railway tracks and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.\u201d \u201cHow far is it, do you think?\u201d Teddy asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Chris. \u201cHarlow\u2019s big. We\u2019re going to have to walk at least twenty miles. Does that sound right to you, Gordie?\u201d \u201cYeah. Maybe more \u2013 thirty miles.\u201d \u201cCome on, you guys,\u201d Chris said, and picked up his backpack, blankets and water bottle.   Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? headline written by Pam Warner (published 07\/12\/16 in Health & Style ) author, date, source What is your Thanksgiving like? Turkey and pumpkin pie? American football on the sofa? In the last couple of years a new trend has become popular in the USA: More people like to eat better quality food and live a more active life. introduction It is slowly going out of fashion to live off convenience and frozen food. A number of people shop for organic food at special supermarkets instead. In some states farmers\u2019 markets offer a great variety of fresh vegetables and fruit from the region. \u201cThere are also dairy products, bread and meat without chemical additives at these markets. Organic food is not only much healthier but it tastes a lot better as well,\u201d explains Emma from Boston. So how about some healthy recipes for Thanksgiving? Maybe pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes? A roast turkey breast or a turkey roulade filled with apples and cranberries is delicious too. But there\u2019s more to a healthy lifestyle than just food. A lot of trend sports show that you can have fun, spend time with friends and stay fit at the same time. Have you found the right sport for you yet? If not, here is a suggestion: How about standup paddleboarding? If you like water, that\u2019s the ideal kind of sport for you. You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: \u201cDrinking too much alcohol isn\u2019t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?\u201d Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don\u2019t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion   A first date Dylan often thought about Abby.

Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy \u2013 after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world\u2019s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren\u2019t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is \u2018fracking\u2019, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, \u201cFracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.\u201d But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada\u2019s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the end of this yet,\u201d says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. \u201cCO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.\u201d 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven\u2019t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won\u2019t change. \u201cWhat worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.\u201d Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable \u2013 which means that when we have used them up, there simply won\u2019t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada\u2019s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better \u2013 and we will have to."}

The Body In \u201cThe Body\u201d, Gordie Lachance and his three friends learn that a boy from their area, in the state of Maine, has disappeared and is probably dead. They decide to go on a trip to find the boy\u2019s body and prepare for the trip. The Gun My room was on the second floor, and it was really hot up there. I was glad I wasn\u2019t sleeping there that night, and the thought of where we were going made me excited again. I rolled up two blankets and tied an old belt around them. I grabbed all my money, which was less than a dollar. Then I was ready to go. I went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad. I was walking up Carbine Street towards the clubhouse when Chris caught up with me. His eyes were shining. \u201cGordie! You want to see something?\u201d \u201cSure. What?\u201d \u201cCome down here first.\u201d He pointed down an alley between two shops. \u201cWhat is it, Chris?\u201d \u201cCome on, I said!\u201d He ran down the alley and I ran after him. At the bottom, the smell from the trash was terrible. \u201cChris, I\u2019m going to puke, I\u2019m \u2013 \u201d But I forgot about the smell when Chris put his hand into his backpack and pulled out a big gun. \u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d \u201cFrom my dad\u2019s desk.\u201d \u201cMan, your dad\u2019s going to beat you when he finds out.\u201d Chris\u2019s eyes just went on dancing. \u201cHe isn\u2019t going to find out. He and his friends have got enough wine to keep them drunk for a week. I\u2019ll put it back before then.\u201d Chris hated alcohol \u2013 he\u2019d already seen too much of what it can do. He was the only one of us who didn\u2019t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they\u2019d stolen from their father. \u201cHave you got bullets for it?\u201d \u201cNine of them \u2013 all that was left in the box. He\u2019ll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.\u201d \u201cAny in it at the moment?\u201d \u201cNo, of course not. What do you think I am?\u201d I finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA \u2013 BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin \u2013 it was the work of an evil magician. \u201cWow!\u201d I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn\u2019t tell if he was amused or scared. \u201cYou did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!\u201d \u201cShut up! Let\u2019s go!\u201d I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. \u201cMan, it\u2019s a pity you couldn\u2019t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.\u201d \u201cYou knew there was a bullet in it, didn\u2019t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad\u2019s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.\u201d Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, \u201cWhat do you think we need a gun for?\u201d \u201cNothing, really,\u201d Chris said. \u201cExcept we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it\u2019s frightening out in the forest at night.\u201d Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?\u201d Teddy asked Vern. \u201cYeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it\u2019ll look as if we\u2019re there after dark.\u201d \u201cHey, man, great!\u201d I said, and slapped Vern on the back. For him, that was real thinking. He grinned. \u201cSo let\u2019s go,\u201d Teddy said. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly twelve already.\u201d Chris stood up and we gathered round him. \u201cWe\u2019ll walk across Beeman\u2019s field,\u201d he said, \u201cand then we\u2019ll get to the railway tracks and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.\u201d \u201cHow far is it, do you think?\u201d Teddy asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Chris. \u201cHarlow\u2019s big. We\u2019re going to have to walk at least twenty miles. Does that sound right to you, Gordie?\u201d \u201cYeah. Maybe more \u2013 thirty miles.\u201d \u201cCome on, you guys,\u201d Chris said, and picked up his backpack, blankets and water bottle.   Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? headline written by Pam Warner (published 07\/12\/16 in Health & Style ) author, date, source What is your Thanksgiving like? Turkey and pumpkin pie? American football on the sofa? In the last couple of years a new trend has become popular in the USA: More people like to eat better quality food and live a more active life. introduction It is slowly going out of fashion to live off convenience and frozen food. A number of people shop for organic food at special supermarkets instead. In some states farmers\u2019 markets offer a great variety of fresh vegetables and fruit from the region. \u201cThere are also dairy products, bread and meat without chemical additives at these markets. Organic food is not only much healthier but it tastes a lot better as well,\u201d explains Emma from Boston. So how about some healthy recipes for Thanksgiving? Maybe pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes? A roast turkey breast or a turkey roulade filled with apples and cranberries is delicious too. But there\u2019s more to a healthy lifestyle than just food. A lot of trend sports show that you can have fun, spend time with friends and stay fit at the same time. Have you found the right sport for you yet? If not, here is a suggestion: How about standup paddleboarding? If you like water, that\u2019s the ideal kind of sport for you. You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: \u201cDrinking too much alcohol isn\u2019t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?\u201d Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don\u2019t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion   A first date Dylan often thought about Abby. He really liked her. But he was too shy to ask her out on a date. Dylan\u2019s friend Forget her. She\u2019s not interested in you. She has a boyfriend. One day his books fell out of his locker right when Abby showed up. With Scott in tow, of course. How embarrassing. Scott Who\u2019s that guy? Look at him! A few days later they had lunch together. Dylan helped Abby with her Science project. They didn\u2019t notice Scott and his football friends. Scott\u2019s friend Isn\u2019t she your girlfriend? Dylan Let me explain. It\u2019s not that hard! When Dylan went to the gym, the boys attacked him. Scott pushed him really hard and Dylan couldn\u2019t do anything about it. Scott Stay away from her! Abby Stop it! You\u2019re hurting him! A few days later Dylan asked Abby, \u201cSo, are you coming to the dance with me?\u201d And she said yes. He was very nervous when he picked her up. Abby\u2019s dad So, young man, you must be Dylan. The party was great. Everybody enjoyed the music and dancing. There was a big surprise that evening. Dylan and Abby were so proud. Presenter We proudly present this year\u2019s Homecoming King and Queen. At the end of the evening Dylan took Abby home. There it was, the perfect moment. But \u2026 Abby\u2019s dad Excuse me?   Living the dream? Interviewer Hello Jos\u00e9. Can I ask you a few questions for our magazine, please? Jos\u00e9 Hi. Sure. Interviewer You\u2019re new on the baseball team. Are you happy? Jos\u00e9 We won the first three matches, so I can\u2019t complain. Interviewer There are lots of players from Latin America here. When did you immigrate to the United States? Jos\u00e9 That was twelve years ago. I was ten. Interviewer That was a big decision for your parents. They left their home and moved to a foreign place. Jos\u00e9 Yes, but they were very poor in Cuba. My father had been unemployed for a long time. My parents wanted to give me and my sisters the best chances. Interviewer What were the first years like? Jos\u00e9 My parents had problems because they hadn\u2019t learned English in school. But there\u2019s a strong community of Cubans here in New York. So my parents opened a small shop for other immigrants. Interviewer And how did you feel? Jos\u00e9 At the beginning I was homesick. I missed my friends. But my parents had given up a lot for me and I slowly got used to my new life. Interviewer When did you begin your baseball career? Jos\u00e9 Before I was 15, I hadn\u2019t taken any sports seriously. Then I joined the baseball team in high school and we were very successful. After I had become the star of my team, my baseball career started. I\u2019ve been very lucky. I can live my dream. For most people it\u2019s much harder. Interviewer What about your plans for the future? Jos\u00e9 I\u2019m a US citizen now and my home is here. But I plan to help people in Cuba. Interviewer Thank you for your time.   Too young to work? Many big farms in California employ children, mostly from Latin America, to pick fruit or vegetables. Children have to help their parents earn their living because migrant parents often don\u2019t have enough income. It is difficult for them to get a better job because many of them don\u2019t have many qualifications or can hardly speak English. Some are even in the USA illegally. All laborers have the legal right to take breaks and get water to drink in the state of California. But in reality things are different. Fresno Weekly Magazine talked to Matteo (12) and his brother Ramon (14) from Sacramento, who have been working on different farms. Fresno Weekly What are the working conditions like for you? Matteo We have to get up at 4:30 in the morning. Buses drive us to the fields, where we work all day in the heat. We sometimes work more than ten hours a day and only earn the minimum wage or even less. The long hours in the fields make you tired. Fresno Weekly Ramon, how long have you been working in the fields? Ramon Since I was ten, just like my Dad. Fresno Weekly Do you have any health problems? Ramon Yes, because of the pesticides I always have difficulty breathing and I have a constant headache out there. But that\u2019s not all. Some people get injured working with the large machines. A federal law from 1938 allows farm owners to employ children from the age of twelve on big farms and even younger children on small farms. From the age of 14 teenagers can do farm work without their parents\u2019 consent. Officially, they are only allowed to work outside school hours, but some of them don\u2019t even finish high school. There are no statistics about how many children spend their days as farm helpers, but the estimate is about half a million. All recent attempts to change the law have failed."}

Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy \u2013 after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world\u2019s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren\u2019t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is \u2018fracking\u2019, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, \u201cFracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.\u201d But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada\u2019s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the end of this yet,\u201d says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. \u201cCO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.\u201d 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven\u2019t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won\u2019t change. \u201cWhat worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.\u201d Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable \u2013 which means that when we have used them up, there simply won\u2019t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada\u2019s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better \u2013 and we will have to.   The sound of ice I\u2019m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn\u2019t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship\u2019s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the \u2018northwest passage\u2019, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn\u2019t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship\u2019s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It\u2019s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn\u2019t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we\u2019d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn\u2019t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn\u2019t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back\u2019s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can\u2019t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let\u2019s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I\u2019m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown.

Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy \u2013 after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world\u2019s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren\u2019t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is \u2018fracking\u2019, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, \u201cFracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.\u201d But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada\u2019s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the end of this yet,\u201d says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. \u201cCO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.\u201d 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven\u2019t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won\u2019t change. \u201cWhat worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.\u201d Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable \u2013 which means that when we have used them up, there simply won\u2019t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada\u2019s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better \u2013 and we will have to.   The sound of ice I\u2019m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time.

(a.lal@vii.com) My name is Emma De Santis. I\u2019m from Germany and I\u2019m 18 years old. I took part in a project at an orphanage in Jaipur last year. My English isn\u2019t bad and I used to work as a babysitter for our neighbours\u2019 kids. I could choose to work from four weeks to ten months. I decided to stay for eight weeks. Before I went to India, I had to get all the important papers. I also knew that I would have to pay the organization almost \u20ac2,000. The flight was not included. So I decided to work in a supermarket to earn the money. When I got the contract for the project in India, I booked my flight and I was ready to go. When I arrived in Jaipur, I was very tired from the journey and the time difference. The heat, the noise and the smells made it even worse. But I still remember a cow lying in front of the phone shop. During the orientation days I met other volunteers from different countries, which was great. After that I met my host family. They were very friendly people. However, I was homesick during the first days, and I had some problems with the food. It was so spicy. At the time I thought, \u201cIf I don\u2019t feel better soon, I\u2019ll have to quit.\u201d But I got over it quickly. My job was great but challenging too. The working conditions were OK. I was teaching 10-year-old girls English and organizing some free-time activities for the younger ones. The staff were very helpful. They all spoke English, which made things a little easier. I quickly found out that things are different in India. Most people\u2019s attitude in India is \u201cWhatever happens, happens.\u201d And usually that\u2019s OK for everyone. Wherever I went, people were smiling at me. But they didn\u2019t just show interest in me, many of them actually stared at me. But you learn to ignore it. I can really recommend taking part in a project like this. I met wonderful people, made new friends and learned a lot about myself. If you go to India, you\u2019ll never forget it.   \u2018I have a dream\u2019 - Martin Luther King, Jr. On April 4, 1968 the African-American minister 1 and US civil rights 2 leader Martin Luther King, Junior was shot in Memphis, Tennessee. The week after his death there were violent protests in cities across the United States. But who was this man whose death shook both a nation and also people around the rest of the world? King was born in the American South, in Atlanta, Georgia, on January 15, 1929. He grew up in a religious family. His father was a Baptist pastor and his mother was a church organist. At that time the people in the American South were segregated 3 . Laws made sure that in the Southern states African-American people did not have the same rights as whites. They had to go to different schools and eat in different restaurants. They weren\u2019t allowed to work with white people. African Americans had to sit at the back of buses and give up their seats to white people. King never wanted to accept this segregation. When he was little, his best friend was a white boy. King, however, had to go to a school for African Americans, while his friend went to a school for whites. So King lost his friend. Over the years King realized how unfair his family and neighbors were treated. He wanted to fight for the civil rights of African Americans. At the age of 18 King decided to become a minister. He felt that the church could give him the best chance to help people and society. He finished college in 1951. He got married to his girlfriend Coretta Scott in 1953, and together they had four children. A year later he became pastor of a Baptist church in Montgomery, Alabama. Protests against racial segregation began in 1955. African-American Rosa Parks hadn\u2019t wanted to give up her bus seat to white people in the city of Montgomery. Rosa Parks was arrested. King started a campaign 4 . For 381 days people didn\u2019t use the city\u2019s public transportation. The campaign was led by Martin Luther King, Jr. During this time his house was bombed and he was arrested too. In the end racial segregation on all Montgomery public transportation was made illegal 5 . It was the first victory 6 for the Civil Rights Movement and it made King a very famous person. In 1957 King and other civil rights activists founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). They wanted to use non-violent protests to achieve 7 civil rights reform. King was influenced by Mahatma Gandhi and his successful non-violent protest against the British Empire in the 1940s. The SCLC started a campaign against racial segregation in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963. Everything was peaceful until the police used water cannons and police dogs against the protesters, even against children. When this was shown on national TV, many white Americans were shocked. The Birmingham campaign was successful and African Americans now had more access 8 to public places. \u2018White Only\u2019 and \u2018Black Only\u2019 signs were removed from restrooms 9 , for example. Early in the Birmingham campaign, King had been arrested again. In his cell he realized that freedom for African-American people would be a long and hard struggle 10 . Later that year King helped organize the March on Washington on August 28, 1963. Its goal was to protest against the way African Americans were treated in Southern states. The protesters wanted an end to racial segregation in schools and at work. They also wanted to protect workers from police brutality. More than 250,000 people joined the march. At the time it was the largest meeting of protesters in the history of Washington, D.C. During this event King gave his most famous speech \u2013 \u2018I have a dream\u2019. It became one of the greatest American speeches. Soon after, civil rights became the most important goal for black and white reformers in the United States. Most of the civil rights became law in 1964 and 1965. King got the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 for his role in the Civil Rights Movement. He was also named \u2018Person of the Year\u2019 by Time magazine. In March 1968 King went to Memphis, Tennessee. He wanted to support African-American workers there who were on strike 11 against bad working conditions. On April 4, 1968 he was shot. James Earl Ray, a white escaped convict 12 , was arrested and was sentenced 13 to 99 years in prison. Since 1983 the third Monday in January has become a national holiday 14 in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. The house where King was born and his grave in Atlanta are national monuments. Streets in towns and cities all over the United States have been named after him. King was the leader of the Civil Rights Movement for almost 13 years. During that time African Americans made a lot of progress on the way towards equality 15 in America. However, many black Americans still experience racial discrimination today. King is known as one of the greatest non-violent leaders in world history. ___ 1 minister [\u02c8m\u026an\u026ast\u0259] \u2212 Pfarrer, Pfarrerin ; 2 civil rights [\u02ccs\u026avl \u02c8ra\u026ats] \u2212 B\u00fcrgerrechte ; 3 segregated [\u02c8segr\u026age\u026at\u026ad] \u2212 getrennt (nach Hautfarbe) ; 4 campaign [k\u04d5\u02c8pe\u026an] \u2212 Kampagne, Aktion ; 5 illegal [\u026a\u02c8li:gl] \u2212 illegal, gesetzeswidrig ; 6 victory [\u02c8v\u026aktri] \u2212 Sieg ; 7 to achieve [\u0259\u02c8t\u222bi:v] \u2212 erreichen ; 8 access [\u02c8\u04d5kses] \u2212 Zugang, Zutritt ; 9 restroom [\u02c8rest\u02ccr\u028am] \u2212 Toilette ; 10 struggle [\u02c8str\u028cgl] \u2212 Kampf ; 11 to be on strike [\u0252n \u02c8stra\u026ak] \u2212 streiken ; 12 escaped convict [\u026a\u02ccske\u026apd \u02c8k\u0252nv\u026akt] \u2212 fl\u00fcchtiger Str\u00e4fling ; 13 to sentence [\u02c8sent\u0259ns] \u2212 verurteilen ; 14 national holiday [\u02ccn\u04d5\u222bnl \u02c8h\u0252l\u0259de\u026a] \u2212 (nationaler) Feiertag ; 15 equality [\u026a\u02c8kw\u0252l\u0259ti] \u2212 Gleichheit"}

The Body In \u201cThe Body\u201d, Gordie Lachance and his three friends learn that a boy from their area, in the state of Maine, has disappeared and is probably dead. They decide to go on a trip to find the boy\u2019s body and prepare for the trip. The Gun My room was on the second floor, and it was really hot up there. I was glad I wasn\u2019t sleeping there that night, and the thought of where we were going made me excited again. I rolled up two blankets and tied an old belt around them. I grabbed all my money, which was less than a dollar. Then I was ready to go. I went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad. I was walking up Carbine Street towards the clubhouse when Chris caught up with me. His eyes were shining. \u201cGordie! You want to see something?\u201d \u201cSure. What?\u201d \u201cCome down here first.\u201d He pointed down an alley between two shops. \u201cWhat is it, Chris?\u201d \u201cCome on, I said!\u201d He ran down the alley and I ran after him. At the bottom, the smell from the trash was terrible. \u201cChris, I\u2019m going to puke, I\u2019m \u2013 \u201d But I forgot about the smell when Chris put his hand into his backpack and pulled out a big gun. \u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d \u201cFrom my dad\u2019s desk.\u201d \u201cMan, your dad\u2019s going to beat you when he finds out.\u201d Chris\u2019s eyes just went on dancing. \u201cHe isn\u2019t going to find out. He and his friends have got enough wine to keep them drunk for a week. I\u2019ll put it back before then.\u201d Chris hated alcohol \u2013 he\u2019d already seen too much of what it can do. He was the only one of us who didn\u2019t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they\u2019d stolen from their father. \u201cHave you got bullets for it?\u201d \u201cNine of them \u2013 all that was left in the box. He\u2019ll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.\u201d \u201cAny in it at the moment?\u201d \u201cNo, of course not. What do you think I am?\u201d I finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA \u2013 BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin \u2013 it was the work of an evil magician. \u201cWow!\u201d I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn\u2019t tell if he was amused or scared. \u201cYou did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!\u201d \u201cShut up! Let\u2019s go!\u201d I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. \u201cMan, it\u2019s a pity you couldn\u2019t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.\u201d \u201cYou knew there was a bullet in it, didn\u2019t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad\u2019s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.\u201d Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, \u201cWhat do you think we need a gun for?\u201d \u201cNothing, really,\u201d Chris said. \u201cExcept we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it\u2019s frightening out in the forest at night.\u201d Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?\u201d Teddy asked Vern. \u201cYeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it\u2019ll look as if we\u2019re there after dark.\u201d \u201cHey, man, great!\u201d I said, and slapped Vern on the back. For him, that was real thinking. He grinned. \u201cSo let\u2019s go,\u201d Teddy said. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly twelve already.\u201d Chris stood up and we gathered round him. \u201cWe\u2019ll walk across Beeman\u2019s field,\u201d he said, \u201cand then we\u2019ll get to the railway tracks and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.\u201d \u201cHow far is it, do you think?\u201d Teddy asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Chris. \u201cHarlow\u2019s big. We\u2019re going to have to walk at least twenty miles. Does that sound right to you, Gordie?\u201d \u201cYeah. Maybe more \u2013 thirty miles.\u201d \u201cCome on, you guys,\u201d Chris said, and picked up his backpack, blankets and water bottle.   Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? headline written by Pam Warner (published 07\/12\/16 in Health & Style ) author, date, source What is your Thanksgiving like? Turkey and pumpkin pie? American football on the sofa? In the last couple of years a new trend has become popular in the USA: More people like to eat better quality food and live a more active life. introduction It is slowly going out of fashion to live off convenience and frozen food. A number of people shop for organic food at special supermarkets instead. In some states farmers\u2019 markets offer a great variety of fresh vegetables and fruit from the region. \u201cThere are also dairy products, bread and meat without chemical additives at these markets. Organic food is not only much healthier but it tastes a lot better as well,\u201d explains Emma from Boston. So how about some healthy recipes for Thanksgiving? Maybe pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes? A roast turkey breast or a turkey roulade filled with apples and cranberries is delicious too. But there\u2019s more to a healthy lifestyle than just food. A lot of trend sports show that you can have fun, spend time with friends and stay fit at the same time. Have you found the right sport for you yet? If not, here is a suggestion: How about standup paddleboarding? If you like water, that\u2019s the ideal kind of sport for you. You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: \u201cDrinking too much alcohol isn\u2019t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?\u201d Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don\u2019t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion"}

The Titanic disaster The Belfast News Wednesday, 17th April 1912 TWO DAYS AFTER \u2013 MORE FACTS The giant ship Titanic, which was built here in Belfast\u2019s shipyard, hit an iceberg on 14th April, shortly before midnight. Water filled the ship until it sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD\u2019S LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship\u2019s builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. LOCAL MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland. The ship\u2019s doctor, Dr John Simpson, 37, was born in Belfast. His mother was optimistic when a letter from him arrived at her home yesterday. However, we have found out that he posted the letter during the ship\u2019s last stop. We now know that Dr Simpson did not survive. DOG SAVES LIVES Some were lucky and the ships which came to save the passengers of the Titanic found their lifeboat. According to a passenger, one of the dogs on board saved the lives of the people in one lifeboat. A ship only found this lifeboat in the dark night and the foggy weather because they heard the dog when it barked. HOW COULD IT HAPPEN? After the sinking of the Titanic a number of questions still need answers. Why did no one see the iceberg? Why did the ship break? Why were there only 20 lifeboats for 2,200 people on board? Why did lifeboats leave the ship when they were not yet full? And how can we make sure that an accident like this will never happen again? About 700 people survived the accident. Some ships today have over 6,500 passengers and crew. After the Titanic\u2019s accident there were laws that ships must have one lifeboat place for every person on board. Dr Simpson\u2019s last letter to his mother is now in the Belfast Titanic museum.   A deadly silence 1. My name is Jonas Fox and I\u2019m twelve years old. I work in the mines and my job is to sit near a door in the tunnel every day. I must open the door when the coal arrives. Then, after it\u2019s gone, I quickly close the door again. Every day I sit in the dark, but I\u2019m never scared. That\u2019s because my friend Billy is always there with me. Billy sings all day long. He\u2019s yellow with little black eyes which look like they are made of glass. Billy is a canary, you see? It\u2019s never boring with Billy around. I would love to sing too, but I can\u2019t even talk. 2. Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine killed 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there\u2019s gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine. One day Bart started to cough and he never stopped coughing after that. Then one night my brother coughed so badly that he died. That was when I stopped talking. I don\u2019t know why, really. I still had words in my head and I opened my mouth, but I couldn\u2019t speak. The men in the mine started to call me \u2018Silent Jonas\u2019 after that. They probably thought I was a bit strange. 4. The day when things got really bad started like any other. Billy was singing like he always did. I heard the people in the tunnels and the noise of the coal trucks. I opened the door and I felt a cold wind in the tunnel. I closed the door again. Billy stopped singing. For a moment I didn\u2019t understand. But then, suddenly, I did: There was gas in the mine! And it could explode any second. I didn\u2019t have time to run down the tunnel to warn the men. If only I could talk, if only I could shout! 5. I knew I had to warn everyone in the mine. So I opened my mouth and tried to say it: \u201cGas.\u201d But there was no sound. Nothing came out. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth again. Nothing. I panicked. We could die in here \u2013 I had to speak! I tried again. This time the sound was quiet, but I made a sound. At last! I opened the door and shouted, \u201cGas. Gas. GAS!\u201d A moment later I heard the sound of the miners\u2019 boots in the tunnels. I took Billy\u2019s cage and ran too. 6. I ran through the tunnel as fast as I could. But my head hurt and I couldn\u2019t breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn\u2019t tell where it was coming from. \u201cCome on, boy!\u201d it said. Somebody picked me up. I turned around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy\u2019s cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn\u2019t just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, \u201cWho warned us?\u201d \u201cMe!\u201d I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. \u201cSilent Jonas found his voice!\u201d a miner shouted. But how could I feel happy? My friend Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small \u2018Tweet\u2019. Billy was alive! I opened the cage \u2026 There were canaries in mines until 1987. Today miners use machines to find out if there is gas in the mine.   The Norman conquest The old king of England, Edward, died in 1066. He had no children and both his Anglo-Saxon brother-in-law, Harold, and his French cousin, William, Duke of Normandy, wanted to be the next king of England. Harold made himself king, and William was very angry. So what did he do next? He sailed to England with his army \u2026 Harold and William fought the battle on Senlac Hill, near Hastings. William\u2019s men were knights and they were better trained. They fought on horses and were good archers. Harold\u2019s men fought on foot and they were already tired from an earlier battle at Stamford Bridge, 200 miles away in the north of England. (Yes, they had to walk those 200 miles!) How do we know what happened during the Battle of Hastings? Well, we have the 70-metre long Bayeux Tapestry to tell us! The tapestry is like a comic and it tells the story of the battle. It tells us that Harold died when he got an arrow in his eye, but we don\u2019t know if this really happened. William won the Battle of Hastings and he became king of England on Christmas Day 1066. Today we know him as William the Conqueror. He was a big castle fan and built lots of them in England, including part of the Tower of London. He also took land from the Anglo-Saxons and gave it to his Norman friends. Did the Normans change England? Yes, of course they did! For example, they brought many new words to the English language. Words like \u2018pork\u2019 and \u2018garden\u2019 come from this time. Guess what? There are still many English people who have Norman surnames, like Archer or Darcy. Before the Normans came to England, most people didn\u2019t even have surnames. They lived in small villages, so a first name or a nickname was often enough. ___ conquest \u2013 Eroberung ; the Anglo-Saxons \u2013 die Angelsachsen (das Volk, das schon vor 1066 in England lebte) ; brother-in-law \u2013 Schwager ; duke \u2013 Herzog ; army \u2013 Heer; Armee ; knight \u2013 Ritter ; archer \u2013 Bogensch\u00fctze; Bogensch\u00fctzin ; tapestry \u2013 Wandteppich ; surname \u2013 Nachname; Familienname   The RNLI: Volunteers on the coast The RNLI is the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. It\u2019s a charity and it saves lives at sea. The RNLI has 237 lifeboat stations and about 4,600 crew members in the UK and Ireland. The RNLI rescues about 8,000 people per year. The RNLI has saved about 140,000 lives since 1824. Many of the lifeboat crew members are volunteers. The RNLI gets money from fundraising. 18th June 2016, by Simon Spade Yesterday the RNLI rescued two teenage boys who got into trouble when they were kayaking off the coast near Llandudno. The two 14-year-old boys went out too far in their kayaks and could not get back to the beach because of strong winds. They tried to get back for more than two and a half hours, then shouted for help and waved. A tourist spotted the boys and made an emergency call to the RNLI. The lifeboat crew left their station at 1:40 p.m. and got to the kayaks in only a few minutes. The RNLI crew picked up the boys and gave them blankets and hot drinks to keep them warm. Lifeboat helm Howard Link called the ambulance to meet them on the beach. Both boys were very weak and seasick. They both spent the night in Llandudno hospital but are back home now. The lifeboat crew got back to their station at 3:25 p.m. There are some rules to remember when you go to the beach: S pot the dangers. A lways go with a friend or adult. F ind and follow the safety signs and flags. E mergency \u2013 put up your hand and shout or call 999\/112. Most lifeboat crew members are volunteers. Let\u2019s meet some.

Name: John Taylor Job: Student Lifeboat youth volunteer: I\u2019m only 16 so I\u2019m too young to join the lifeboat crew, but I work at the station.

The Body In \u201cThe Body\u201d, Gordie Lachance and his three friends learn that a boy from their area, in the state of Maine, has disappeared and is probably dead. They decide to go on a trip to find the boy\u2019s body and prepare for the trip. The Gun My room was on the second floor, and it was really hot up there. I was glad I wasn\u2019t sleeping there that night, and the thought of where we were going made me excited again. I rolled up two blankets and tied an old belt around them. I grabbed all my money, which was less than a dollar. Then I was ready to go. I went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad. I was walking up Carbine Street towards the clubhouse when Chris caught up with me. His eyes were shining. \u201cGordie! You want to see something?\u201d \u201cSure. What?\u201d \u201cCome down here first.\u201d He pointed down an alley between two shops. \u201cWhat is it, Chris?\u201d \u201cCome on, I said!\u201d He ran down the alley and I ran after him. At the bottom, the smell from the trash was terrible. \u201cChris, I\u2019m going to puke, I\u2019m \u2013 \u201d But I forgot about the smell when Chris put his hand into his backpack and pulled out a big gun. \u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d \u201cFrom my dad\u2019s desk.\u201d \u201cMan, your dad\u2019s going to beat you when he finds out.\u201d Chris\u2019s eyes just went on dancing. \u201cHe isn\u2019t going to find out. He and his friends have got enough wine to keep them drunk for a week. I\u2019ll put it back before then.\u201d Chris hated alcohol \u2013 he\u2019d already seen too much of what it can do. He was the only one of us who didn\u2019t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they\u2019d stolen from their father. \u201cHave you got bullets for it?\u201d \u201cNine of them \u2013 all that was left in the box. He\u2019ll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.\u201d \u201cAny in it at the moment?\u201d \u201cNo, of course not. What do you think I am?\u201d I finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA \u2013 BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin \u2013 it was the work of an evil magician. \u201cWow!\u201d I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn\u2019t tell if he was amused or scared. \u201cYou did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!\u201d \u201cShut up! Let\u2019s go!\u201d I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. \u201cMan, it\u2019s a pity you couldn\u2019t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.\u201d \u201cYou knew there was a bullet in it, didn\u2019t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad\u2019s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.\u201d Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, \u201cWhat do you think we need a gun for?\u201d \u201cNothing, really,\u201d Chris said. \u201cExcept we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it\u2019s frightening out in the forest at night.\u201d Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?\u201d Teddy asked Vern. \u201cYeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it\u2019ll look as if we\u2019re there after dark.\u201d \u201cHey, man, great!\u201d I said, and slapped Vern on the back. For him, that was real thinking. He grinned. \u201cSo let\u2019s go,\u201d Teddy said. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly twelve already.\u201d Chris stood up and we gathered round him. \u201cWe\u2019ll walk across Beeman\u2019s field,\u201d he said, \u201cand then we\u2019ll get to the railway tracks and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.\u201d \u201cHow far is it, do you think?\u201d Teddy asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Chris. \u201cHarlow\u2019s big. We\u2019re going to have to walk at least twenty miles. Does that sound right to you, Gordie?\u201d \u201cYeah. Maybe more \u2013 thirty miles.\u201d \u201cCome on, you guys,\u201d Chris said, and picked up his backpack, blankets and water bottle.   Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? headline written by Pam Warner (published 07\/12\/16 in Health & Style ) author, date, source What is your Thanksgiving like? Turkey and pumpkin pie? American football on the sofa? In the last couple of years a new trend has become popular in the USA: More people like to eat better quality food and live a more active life. introduction It is slowly going out of fashion to live off convenience and frozen food. A number of people shop for organic food at special supermarkets instead. In some states farmers\u2019 markets offer a great variety of fresh vegetables and fruit from the region. \u201cThere are also dairy products, bread and meat without chemical additives at these markets. Organic food is not only much healthier but it tastes a lot better as well,\u201d explains Emma from Boston. So how about some healthy recipes for Thanksgiving? Maybe pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes? A roast turkey breast or a turkey roulade filled with apples and cranberries is delicious too. But there\u2019s more to a healthy lifestyle than just food. A lot of trend sports show that you can have fun, spend time with friends and stay fit at the same time. Have you found the right sport for you yet? If not, here is a suggestion: How about standup paddleboarding? If you like water, that\u2019s the ideal kind of sport for you. You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: \u201cDrinking too much alcohol isn\u2019t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?\u201d Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don\u2019t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion   A first date Dylan often thought about Abby. He really liked her. But he was too shy to ask her out on a date. Dylan\u2019s friend Forget her. She\u2019s not interested in you. She has a boyfriend. One day his books fell out of his locker right when Abby showed up. With Scott in tow, of course. How embarrassing. Scott Who\u2019s that guy? Look at him! A few days later they had lunch together. Dylan helped Abby with her Science project. They didn\u2019t notice Scott and his football friends. Scott\u2019s friend Isn\u2019t she your girlfriend? Dylan Let me explain. It\u2019s not that hard! When Dylan went to the gym, the boys attacked him. Scott pushed him really hard and Dylan couldn\u2019t do anything about it. Scott Stay away from her! Abby Stop it! You\u2019re hurting him! A few days later Dylan asked Abby, \u201cSo, are you coming to the dance with me?\u201d And she said yes. He was very nervous when he picked her up. Abby\u2019s dad So, young man, you must be Dylan. The party was great. Everybody enjoyed the music and dancing. There was a big surprise that evening. Dylan and Abby were so proud. Presenter We proudly present this year\u2019s Homecoming King and Queen. At the end of the evening Dylan took Abby home. There it was, the perfect moment. But \u2026 Abby\u2019s dad Excuse me?   Living the dream? Interviewer Hello Jos\u00e9. Can I ask you a few questions for our magazine, please? Jos\u00e9 Hi. Sure. Interviewer You\u2019re new on the baseball team. Are you happy? Jos\u00e9 We won the first three matches, so I can\u2019t complain. Interviewer There are lots of players from Latin America here. When did you immigrate to the United States? Jos\u00e9 That was twelve years ago. I was ten. Interviewer That was a big decision for your parents. They left their home and moved to a foreign place. Jos\u00e9 Yes, but they were very poor in Cuba. My father had been unemployed for a long time. My parents wanted to give me and my sisters the best chances. Interviewer What were the first years like? Jos\u00e9 My parents had problems because they hadn\u2019t learned English in school. But there\u2019s a strong community of Cubans here in New York. So my parents opened a small shop for other immigrants. Interviewer And how did you feel? Jos\u00e9 At the beginning I was homesick. I missed my friends. But my parents had given up a lot for me and I slowly got used to my new life. Interviewer When did you begin your baseball career? Jos\u00e9 Before I was 15, I hadn\u2019t taken any sports seriously. Then I joined the baseball team in high school and we were very successful. After I had become the star of my team, my baseball career started. I\u2019ve been very lucky. I can live my dream. For most people it\u2019s much harder. Interviewer What about your plans for the future? Jos\u00e9 I\u2019m a US citizen now and my home is here. But I plan to help people in Cuba. Interviewer Thank you for your time.   Too young to work? Many big farms in California employ children, mostly from Latin America, to pick fruit or vegetables. Children have to help their parents earn their living because migrant parents often don\u2019t have enough income. It is difficult for them to get a better job because many of them don\u2019t have many qualifications or can hardly speak English. Some are even in the USA illegally. All laborers have the legal right to take breaks and get water to drink in the state of California. But in reality things are different. Fresno Weekly Magazine talked to Matteo (12) and his brother Ramon (14) from Sacramento, who have been working on different farms. Fresno Weekly What are the working conditions like for you? Matteo We have to get up at 4:30 in the morning. Buses drive us to the fields, where we work all day in the heat. We sometimes work more than ten hours a day and only earn the minimum wage or even less. The long hours in the fields make you tired. Fresno Weekly Ramon, how long have you been working in the fields? Ramon Since I was ten, just like my Dad. Fresno Weekly Do you have any health problems? Ramon Yes, because of the pesticides I always have difficulty breathing and I have a constant headache out there. But that\u2019s not all. Some people get injured working with the large machines. A federal law from 1938 allows farm owners to employ children from the age of twelve on big farms and even younger children on small farms. From the age of 14 teenagers can do farm work without their parents\u2019 consent. Officially, they are only allowed to work outside school hours, but some of them don\u2019t even finish high school. There are no statistics about how many children spend their days as farm helpers, but the estimate is about half a million. All recent attempts to change the law have failed."}

Think about these questions: Where are you now? How do you feel? What was it like on the lifeboat?    The Titanic disaster The Belfast News Wednesday, 17th April 1912 TWO DAYS AFTER \u2013 MORE FACTS The giant ship Titanic, which was built here in Belfast\u2019s shipyard, hit an iceberg on 14th April, shortly before midnight. Water filled the ship until it sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD\u2019S LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship\u2019s builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. LOCAL MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland. The ship\u2019s doctor, Dr John Simpson, 37, was born in Belfast. His mother was optimistic when a letter from him arrived at her home yesterday. However, we have found out that he posted the letter during the ship\u2019s last stop. We now know that Dr Simpson did not survive. DOG SAVES LIVES Some were lucky and the ships which came to save the passengers of the Titanic found their lifeboat. According to a passenger, one of the dogs on board saved the lives of the people in one lifeboat. A ship only found this lifeboat in the dark night and the foggy weather because they heard the dog when it barked. HOW COULD IT HAPPEN? After the sinking of the Titanic a number of questions still need answers. Why did no one see the iceberg? Why did the ship break? Why were there only 20 lifeboats for 2,200 people on board? Why did lifeboats leave the ship when they were not yet full? And how can we make sure that an accident like this will never happen again? About 700 people survived the accident. Some ships today have over 6,500 passengers and crew. After the Titanic\u2019s accident there were laws that ships must have one lifeboat place for every person on board. Dr Simpson\u2019s last letter to his mother is now in the Belfast Titanic museum."}

Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy \u2013 after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world\u2019s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren\u2019t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is \u2018fracking\u2019, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, \u201cFracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.\u201d But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada\u2019s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the end of this yet,\u201d says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. \u201cCO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.\u201d 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven\u2019t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won\u2019t change. \u201cWhat worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.\u201d Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable \u2013 which means that when we have used them up, there simply won\u2019t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada\u2019s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better \u2013 and we will have to.   The sound of ice I\u2019m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn\u2019t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship\u2019s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the \u2018northwest passage\u2019, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn\u2019t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship\u2019s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It\u2019s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn\u2019t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we\u2019d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn\u2019t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn\u2019t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back\u2019s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can\u2019t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let\u2019s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I\u2019m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown.

He put his hand in his pocket, but his phone wasn\u2019t there! \u201cOh no, I must have forgotten it on the bus!\u201d He looked up. But the bus wasn\u2019t there any more. Luke went home and phoned the bus company. They wanted to help but first they needed a special number from his phone \u2013 and he didn\u2019t know the number! Luke didn\u2019t enjoy his dinner at all that night. Why wasn\u2019t he more careful with his phone? Suddenly the doorbell rang. \u201cGwen\u2019s here!\u201d shouted Luke\u2019s mum from the hall.

Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy \u2013 after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world\u2019s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren\u2019t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is \u2018fracking\u2019, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, \u201cFracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.\u201d But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada\u2019s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the end of this yet,\u201d says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. \u201cCO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.\u201d 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven\u2019t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won\u2019t change. \u201cWhat worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.\u201d Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable \u2013 which means that when we have used them up, there simply won\u2019t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada\u2019s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better \u2013 and we will have to.   The sound of ice I\u2019m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn\u2019t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship\u2019s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the \u2018northwest passage\u2019, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn\u2019t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship\u2019s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It\u2019s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn\u2019t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we\u2019d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn\u2019t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn\u2019t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back\u2019s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can\u2019t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let\u2019s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I\u2019m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown.

How does the author finish?    We can do even better \u2013 by Lindsay Fern (21\/1\/2017) 1. Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy \u2013 after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world\u2019s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren\u2019t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is \u2018fracking\u2019, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, \u201cFracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.\u201d But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada\u2019s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the end of this yet,\u201d says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. \u201cCO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.\u201d 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven\u2019t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won\u2019t change. \u201cWhat worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.\u201d Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable \u2013 which means that when we have used them up, there simply won\u2019t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada\u2019s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better \u2013 and we will have to."}

I thought it was a magical city with a very special atmosphere. It\u2019s small enough to get around easily and not feel lost, but big enough that there\u2019s a lot to do. So after I left school, I decided to go to university there. It was a good decision \u2013 I had a wonderful time! The locals were really friendly and after some time I even started to understand the Edinburgh accent. In fact, I loved Edinburgh so much that I stayed after university. At first I lived and worked in the city, but after I met my husband (who is a true Scotsman!) we moved to the countryside nearby. I work from home now as I have my own business. But I love to drive to the city at the weekend in my Mini. Last week my parents came to stay and we visited Edinburgh Castle and the Scottish National Gallery. One day we took the children to the zoo, and another day we took a boat out to Inchcolm Abbey on a nearby island. Most days we had a picnic lunch in the Princes Street Gardens.I love that there are so many different things to do in Edinburgh. This city really has become my home now.

There was a party in the village this evening. But it wasn\u2019t fun. There was a barbecue 1 and then singing and dancing. But the music was awful. I was so bored that I turned their music off and played some hip-hop 2 instead. Everybody was mad and shouted at me. I laughed at them and left. I hate this place and I hate these people.

I woke up in the middle of the night because there was a loud noise in the house. I went to the kitchen and saw Aunt Susan there. She was on the phone, and she was very excited.

She needed help with her calf. Some other people from the village were there too. They were all very calm and knew what to do. They told me to hold the light so that the vet could see well. I could hardly look. That noise! And it smelt terrible. Yuck! 5 Then it was there. A little calf. So sweet, so clumsy. We all felt very happy. I was so tired but so excited. I got up early again.

The Body In \u201cThe Body\u201d, Gordie Lachance and his three friends learn that a boy from their area, in the state of Maine, has disappeared and is probably dead. They decide to go on a trip to find the boy\u2019s body and prepare for the trip. The Gun My room was on the second floor, and it was really hot up there. I was glad I wasn\u2019t sleeping there that night, and the thought of where we were going made me excited again. I rolled up two blankets and tied an old belt around them. I grabbed all my money, which was less than a dollar. Then I was ready to go. I went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad. I was walking up Carbine Street towards the clubhouse when Chris caught up with me. His eyes were shining. \u201cGordie! You want to see something?\u201d \u201cSure. What?\u201d \u201cCome down here first.\u201d He pointed down an alley between two shops. \u201cWhat is it, Chris?\u201d \u201cCome on, I said!\u201d He ran down the alley and I ran after him. At the bottom, the smell from the trash was terrible. \u201cChris, I\u2019m going to puke, I\u2019m \u2013 \u201d But I forgot about the smell when Chris put his hand into his backpack and pulled out a big gun. \u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d \u201cFrom my dad\u2019s desk.\u201d \u201cMan, your dad\u2019s going to beat you when he finds out.\u201d Chris\u2019s eyes just went on dancing. \u201cHe isn\u2019t going to find out. He and his friends have got enough wine to keep them drunk for a week. I\u2019ll put it back before then.\u201d Chris hated alcohol \u2013 he\u2019d already seen too much of what it can do. He was the only one of us who didn\u2019t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they\u2019d stolen from their father. \u201cHave you got bullets for it?\u201d \u201cNine of them \u2013 all that was left in the box. He\u2019ll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.\u201d \u201cAny in it at the moment?\u201d \u201cNo, of course not. What do you think I am?\u201d I finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA \u2013 BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin \u2013 it was the work of an evil magician. \u201cWow!\u201d I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn\u2019t tell if he was amused or scared. \u201cYou did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!\u201d \u201cShut up! Let\u2019s go!\u201d I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. \u201cMan, it\u2019s a pity you couldn\u2019t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.\u201d \u201cYou knew there was a bullet in it, didn\u2019t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad\u2019s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.\u201d Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, \u201cWhat do you think we need a gun for?\u201d \u201cNothing, really,\u201d Chris said. \u201cExcept we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it\u2019s frightening out in the forest at night.\u201d Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?\u201d Teddy asked Vern. \u201cYeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it\u2019ll look as if we\u2019re there after dark.\u201d \u201cHey, man, great!\u201d I said, and slapped Vern on the back.

Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? headline written by Pam Warner (published 07\/12\/16 in Health & Style ) author, date, source What is your Thanksgiving like? Turkey and pumpkin pie? American football on the sofa? In the last couple of years a new trend has become popular in the USA: More people like to eat better quality food and live a more active life. introduction It is slowly going out of fashion to live off convenience and frozen food. A number of people shop for organic food at special supermarkets instead. In some states farmers\u2019 markets offer a great variety of fresh vegetables and fruit from the region. \u201cThere are also dairy products, bread and meat without chemical additives at these markets. Organic food is not only much healthier but it tastes a lot better as well,\u201d explains Emma from Boston. So how about some healthy recipes for Thanksgiving? Maybe pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes? A roast turkey breast or a turkey roulade filled with apples and cranberries is delicious too. But there\u2019s more to a healthy lifestyle than just food. A lot of trend sports show that you can have fun, spend time with friends and stay fit at the same time. Have you found the right sport for you yet? If not, here is a suggestion: How about standup paddleboarding? If you like water, that\u2019s the ideal kind of sport for you. You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: \u201cDrinking too much alcohol isn\u2019t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?\u201d Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don\u2019t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion   A first date Dylan often thought about Abby. He really liked her. But he was too shy to ask her out on a date. Dylan\u2019s friend Forget her. She\u2019s not interested in you. She has a boyfriend. One day his books fell out of his locker right when Abby showed up. With Scott in tow, of course. How embarrassing. Scott Who\u2019s that guy? Look at him! A few days later they had lunch together. Dylan helped Abby with her Science project. They didn\u2019t notice Scott and his football friends. Scott\u2019s friend Isn\u2019t she your girlfriend? Dylan Let me explain. It\u2019s not that hard! When Dylan went to the gym, the boys attacked him. Scott pushed him really hard and Dylan couldn\u2019t do anything about it. Scott Stay away from her! Abby Stop it! You\u2019re hurting him! A few days later Dylan asked Abby, \u201cSo, are you coming to the dance with me?\u201d And she said yes. He was very nervous when he picked her up. Abby\u2019s dad So, young man, you must be Dylan. The party was great. Everybody enjoyed the music and dancing. There was a big surprise that evening. Dylan and Abby were so proud. Presenter We proudly present this year\u2019s Homecoming King and Queen. At the end of the evening Dylan took Abby home. There it was, the perfect moment. But \u2026 Abby\u2019s dad Excuse me?   Living the dream? Interviewer Hello Jos\u00e9. Can I ask you a few questions for our magazine, please? Jos\u00e9 Hi. Sure. Interviewer You\u2019re new on the baseball team. Are you happy? Jos\u00e9 We won the first three matches, so I can\u2019t complain. Interviewer There are lots of players from Latin America here. When did you immigrate to the United States? Jos\u00e9 That was twelve years ago. I was ten. Interviewer That was a big decision for your parents. They left their home and moved to a foreign place. Jos\u00e9 Yes, but they were very poor in Cuba. My father had been unemployed for a long time. My parents wanted to give me and my sisters the best chances. Interviewer What were the first years like? Jos\u00e9 My parents had problems because they hadn\u2019t learned English in school. But there\u2019s a strong community of Cubans here in New York. So my parents opened a small shop for other immigrants. Interviewer And how did you feel? Jos\u00e9 At the beginning I was homesick. I missed my friends. But my parents had given up a lot for me and I slowly got used to my new life. Interviewer When did you begin your baseball career? Jos\u00e9 Before I was 15, I hadn\u2019t taken any sports seriously. Then I joined the baseball team in high school and we were very successful. After I had become the star of my team, my baseball career started. I\u2019ve been very lucky. I can live my dream. For most people it\u2019s much harder. Interviewer What about your plans for the future? Jos\u00e9 I\u2019m a US citizen now and my home is here. But I plan to help people in Cuba. Interviewer Thank you for your time.   Too young to work? Many big farms in California employ children, mostly from Latin America, to pick fruit or vegetables. Children have to help their parents earn their living because migrant parents often don\u2019t have enough income. It is difficult for them to get a better job because many of them don\u2019t have many qualifications or can hardly speak English. Some are even in the USA illegally. All laborers have the legal right to take breaks and get water to drink in the state of California. But in reality things are different. Fresno Weekly Magazine talked to Matteo (12) and his brother Ramon (14) from Sacramento, who have been working on different farms. Fresno Weekly What are the working conditions like for you? Matteo We have to get up at 4:30 in the morning. Buses drive us to the fields, where we work all day in the heat. We sometimes work more than ten hours a day and only earn the minimum wage or even less. The long hours in the fields make you tired. Fresno Weekly Ramon, how long have you been working in the fields? Ramon Since I was ten, just like my Dad. Fresno Weekly Do you have any health problems? Ramon Yes, because of the pesticides I always have difficulty breathing and I have a constant headache out there. But that\u2019s not all. Some people get injured working with the large machines. A federal law from 1938 allows farm owners to employ children from the age of twelve on big farms and even younger children on small farms. From the age of 14 teenagers can do farm work without their parents\u2019 consent. Officially, they are only allowed to work outside school hours, but some of them don\u2019t even finish high school. There are no statistics about how many children spend their days as farm helpers, but the estimate is about half a million. All recent attempts to change the law have failed."}

Water filled the ship until it sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD\u2019S LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship\u2019s builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. LOCAL MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland. The ship\u2019s doctor, Dr John Simpson, 37, was born in Belfast. His mother was optimistic when a letter from him arrived at her home yesterday. However, we have found out that he posted the letter during the ship\u2019s last stop. We now know that Dr Simpson did not survive. DOG SAVES LIVES Some were lucky and the ships which came to save the passengers of the Titanic found their lifeboat. According to a passenger, one of the dogs on board saved the lives of the people in one lifeboat. A ship only found this lifeboat in the dark night and the foggy weather because they heard the dog when it barked. HOW COULD IT HAPPEN? After the sinking of the Titanic a number of questions still need answers. Why did no one see the iceberg? Why did the ship break? Why were there only 20 lifeboats for 2,200 people on board? Why did lifeboats leave the ship when they were not yet full? And how can we make sure that an accident like this will never happen again? About 700 people survived the accident. Some ships today have over 6,500 passengers and crew. After the Titanic\u2019s accident there were laws that ships must have one lifeboat place for every person on board. Dr Simpson\u2019s last letter to his mother is now in the Belfast Titanic museum.   A deadly silence 1. My name is Jonas Fox and I\u2019m twelve years old. I work in the mines and my job is to sit near a door in the tunnel every day. I must open the door when the coal arrives. Then, after it\u2019s gone, I quickly close the door again. Every day I sit in the dark, but I\u2019m never scared. That\u2019s because my friend Billy is always there with me. Billy sings all day long. He\u2019s yellow with little black eyes which look like they are made of glass. Billy is a canary, you see? It\u2019s never boring with Billy around. I would love to sing too, but I can\u2019t even talk. 2. Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine killed 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there\u2019s gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine. One day Bart started to cough and he never stopped coughing after that. Then one night my brother coughed so badly that he died. That was when I stopped talking. I don\u2019t know why, really. I still had words in my head and I opened my mouth, but I couldn\u2019t speak. The men in the mine started to call me \u2018Silent Jonas\u2019 after that. They probably thought I was a bit strange. 4. The day when things got really bad started like any other. Billy was singing like he always did. I heard the people in the tunnels and the noise of the coal trucks. I opened the door and I felt a cold wind in the tunnel. I closed the door again. Billy stopped singing. For a moment I didn\u2019t understand. But then, suddenly, I did: There was gas in the mine! And it could explode any second. I didn\u2019t have time to run down the tunnel to warn the men. If only I could talk, if only I could shout! 5. I knew I had to warn everyone in the mine. So I opened my mouth and tried to say it: \u201cGas.\u201d But there was no sound. Nothing came out. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth again. Nothing. I panicked. We could die in here \u2013 I had to speak! I tried again. This time the sound was quiet, but I made a sound. At last! I opened the door and shouted, \u201cGas. Gas. GAS!\u201d A moment later I heard the sound of the miners\u2019 boots in the tunnels. I took Billy\u2019s cage and ran too. 6. I ran through the tunnel as fast as I could. But my head hurt and I couldn\u2019t breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn\u2019t tell where it was coming from. \u201cCome on, boy!\u201d it said. Somebody picked me up. I turned around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy\u2019s cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn\u2019t just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, \u201cWho warned us?\u201d \u201cMe!\u201d I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. \u201cSilent Jonas found his voice!\u201d a miner shouted. But how could I feel happy? My friend Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small \u2018Tweet\u2019. Billy was alive! I opened the cage \u2026 There were canaries in mines until 1987. Today miners use machines to find out if there is gas in the mine.   The Norman conquest The old king of England, Edward, died in 1066. He had no children and both his Anglo-Saxon brother-in-law, Harold, and his French cousin, William, Duke of Normandy, wanted to be the next king of England. Harold made himself king, and William was very angry. So what did he do next? He sailed to England with his army \u2026 Harold and William fought the battle on Senlac Hill, near Hastings. William\u2019s men were knights and they were better trained. They fought on horses and were good archers. Harold\u2019s men fought on foot and they were already tired from an earlier battle at Stamford Bridge, 200 miles away in the north of England. (Yes, they had to walk those 200 miles!) How do we know what happened during the Battle of Hastings? Well, we have the 70-metre long Bayeux Tapestry to tell us! The tapestry is like a comic and it tells the story of the battle. It tells us that Harold died when he got an arrow in his eye, but we don\u2019t know if this really happened. William won the Battle of Hastings and he became king of England on Christmas Day 1066. Today we know him as William the Conqueror. He was a big castle fan and built lots of them in England, including part of the Tower of London. He also took land from the Anglo-Saxons and gave it to his Norman friends. Did the Normans change England? Yes, of course they did! For example, they brought many new words to the English language. Words like \u2018pork\u2019 and \u2018garden\u2019 come from this time. Guess what? There are still many English people who have Norman surnames, like Archer or Darcy. Before the Normans came to England, most people didn\u2019t even have surnames. They lived in small villages, so a first name or a nickname was often enough. ___ conquest \u2013 Eroberung ; the Anglo-Saxons \u2013 die Angelsachsen (das Volk, das schon vor 1066 in England lebte) ; brother-in-law \u2013 Schwager ; duke \u2013 Herzog ; army \u2013 Heer; Armee ; knight \u2013 Ritter ; archer \u2013 Bogensch\u00fctze; Bogensch\u00fctzin ; tapestry \u2013 Wandteppich ; surname \u2013 Nachname; Familienname   The RNLI: Volunteers on the coast The RNLI is the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.

The two 14-year-old boys went out too far in their kayaks and could not get back to the beach because of strong winds. They tried to get back for more than two and a half hours, then shouted for help and waved. A tourist spotted the boys and made an emergency call to the RNLI. The lifeboat crew left their station at 1:40 p.m. and got to the kayaks in only a few minutes. The RNLI crew picked up the boys and gave them blankets and hot drinks to keep them warm. Lifeboat helm Howard Link called the ambulance to meet them on the beach. Both boys were very weak and seasick. They both spent the night in Llandudno hospital but are back home now. The lifeboat crew got back to their station at 3:25 p.m. There are some rules to remember when you go to the beach: S pot the dangers. A lways go with a friend or adult.

The Titanic disaster The Belfast News Wednesday, 17th April 1912 TWO DAYS AFTER \u2013 MORE FACTS The giant ship Titanic, which was built here in Belfast\u2019s shipyard, hit an iceberg on 14th April, shortly before midnight. Water filled the ship until it sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD\u2019S LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship\u2019s builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. LOCAL MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland. The ship\u2019s doctor, Dr John Simpson, 37, was born in Belfast. His mother was optimistic when a letter from him arrived at her home yesterday. However, we have found out that he posted the letter during the ship\u2019s last stop. We now know that Dr Simpson did not survive. DOG SAVES LIVES Some were lucky and the ships which came to save the passengers of the Titanic found their lifeboat. According to a passenger, one of the dogs on board saved the lives of the people in one lifeboat. A ship only found this lifeboat in the dark night and the foggy weather because they heard the dog when it barked. HOW COULD IT HAPPEN? After the sinking of the Titanic a number of questions still need answers. Why did no one see the iceberg? Why did the ship break? Why were there only 20 lifeboats for 2,200 people on board? Why did lifeboats leave the ship when they were not yet full? And how can we make sure that an accident like this will never happen again? About 700 people survived the accident. Some ships today have over 6,500 passengers and crew. After the Titanic\u2019s accident there were laws that ships must have one lifeboat place for every person on board. Dr Simpson\u2019s last letter to his mother is now in the Belfast Titanic museum.   A deadly silence 1. My name is Jonas Fox and I\u2019m twelve years old. I work in the mines and my job is to sit near a door in the tunnel every day. I must open the door when the coal arrives. Then, after it\u2019s gone, I quickly close the door again. Every day I sit in the dark, but I\u2019m never scared. That\u2019s because my friend Billy is always there with me. Billy sings all day long. He\u2019s yellow with little black eyes which look like they are made of glass. Billy is a canary, you see? It\u2019s never boring with Billy around. I would love to sing too, but I can\u2019t even talk. 2. Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine killed 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there\u2019s gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine. One day Bart started to cough and he never stopped coughing after that. Then one night my brother coughed so badly that he died. That was when I stopped talking. I don\u2019t know why, really. I still had words in my head and I opened my mouth, but I couldn\u2019t speak. The men in the mine started to call me \u2018Silent Jonas\u2019 after that. They probably thought I was a bit strange. 4. The day when things got really bad started like any other. Billy was singing like he always did. I heard the people in the tunnels and the noise of the coal trucks. I opened the door and I felt a cold wind in the tunnel. I closed the door again. Billy stopped singing. For a moment I didn\u2019t understand. But then, suddenly, I did: There was gas in the mine! And it could explode any second. I didn\u2019t have time to run down the tunnel to warn the men. If only I could talk, if only I could shout! 5. I knew I had to warn everyone in the mine. So I opened my mouth and tried to say it: \u201cGas.\u201d But there was no sound. Nothing came out. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth again. Nothing. I panicked. We could die in here \u2013 I had to speak! I tried again. This time the sound was quiet, but I made a sound. At last! I opened the door and shouted, \u201cGas. Gas. GAS!\u201d A moment later I heard the sound of the miners\u2019 boots in the tunnels. I took Billy\u2019s cage and ran too. 6. I ran through the tunnel as fast as I could. But my head hurt and I couldn\u2019t breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn\u2019t tell where it was coming from. \u201cCome on, boy!\u201d it said. Somebody picked me up. I turned around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy\u2019s cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn\u2019t just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, \u201cWho warned us?\u201d \u201cMe!\u201d I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. \u201cSilent Jonas found his voice!\u201d a miner shouted. But how could I feel happy? My friend Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small \u2018Tweet\u2019. Billy was alive! I opened the cage \u2026 There were canaries in mines until 1987.

Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy \u2013 after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world\u2019s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren\u2019t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is \u2018fracking\u2019, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, \u201cFracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.\u201d But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada\u2019s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the end of this yet,\u201d says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. \u201cCO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.\u201d 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven\u2019t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won\u2019t change. \u201cWhat worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.\u201d Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable \u2013 which means that when we have used them up, there simply won\u2019t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada\u2019s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better \u2013 and we will have to.   The sound of ice I\u2019m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn\u2019t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship\u2019s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the \u2018northwest passage\u2019, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn\u2019t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship\u2019s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It\u2019s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn\u2019t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we\u2019d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn\u2019t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn\u2019t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back\u2019s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can\u2019t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let\u2019s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I\u2019m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown.

I thought it was a magical city with a very special atmosphere. It\u2019s small enough to get around easily and not feel lost, but big enough that there\u2019s a lot to do. So after I left school, I decided to go to university there. It was a good decision \u2013 I had a wonderful time! The locals were really friendly and after some time I even started to understand the Edinburgh accent. In fact, I loved Edinburgh so much that I stayed after university. At first I lived and worked in the city, but after I met my husband (who is a true Scotsman!) we moved to the countryside nearby. I work from home now as I have my own business. But I love to drive to the city at the weekend in my Mini. Last week my parents came to stay and we visited Edinburgh Castle and the Scottish National Gallery. One day we took the children to the zoo, and another day we took a boat out to Inchcolm Abbey on a nearby island.

I was glad I wasn\u2019t sleeping there that night, and the thought of where we were going made me excited again. I rolled up two blankets and tied an old belt around them. I grabbed all my money, which was less than a dollar. Then I was ready to go. I went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad. I was walking up Carbine Street towards the clubhouse when Chris caught up with me. His eyes were shining. \u201cGordie! You want to see something?\u201d \u201cSure. What?\u201d \u201cCome down here first.\u201d He pointed down an alley between two shops. \u201cWhat is it, Chris?\u201d \u201cCome on, I said!\u201d He ran down the alley and I ran after him.

It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin \u2013 it was the work of an evil magician. \u201cWow!\u201d I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn\u2019t tell if he was amused or scared. \u201cYou did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!\u201d \u201cShut up! Let\u2019s go!\u201d I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. \u201cMan, it\u2019s a pity you couldn\u2019t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.\u201d \u201cYou knew there was a bullet in it, didn\u2019t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad\u2019s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.\u201d Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, \u201cWhat do you think we need a gun for?\u201d \u201cNothing, really,\u201d Chris said. \u201cExcept we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it\u2019s frightening out in the forest at night.\u201d Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?\u201d Teddy asked Vern. \u201cYeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it\u2019ll look as if we\u2019re there after dark.\u201d \u201cHey, man, great!\u201d I said, and slapped Vern on the back. For him, that was real thinking. He grinned. \u201cSo let\u2019s go,\u201d Teddy said. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly twelve already.\u201d Chris stood up and we gathered round him. \u201cWe\u2019ll walk across Beeman\u2019s field,\u201d he said, \u201cand then we\u2019ll get to the railway tracks and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.\u201d \u201cHow far is it, do you think?\u201d Teddy asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Chris. \u201cHarlow\u2019s big. We\u2019re going to have to walk at least twenty miles. Does that sound right to you, Gordie?\u201d \u201cYeah. Maybe more \u2013 thirty miles.\u201d \u201cCome on, you guys,\u201d Chris said, and picked up his backpack, blankets and water bottle.   Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? headline written by Pam Warner (published 07\/12\/16 in Health & Style ) author, date, source What is your Thanksgiving like? Turkey and pumpkin pie? American football on the sofa? In the last couple of years a new trend has become popular in the USA: More people like to eat better quality food and live a more active life. introduction It is slowly going out of fashion to live off convenience and frozen food. A number of people shop for organic food at special supermarkets instead. In some states farmers\u2019 markets offer a great variety of fresh vegetables and fruit from the region. \u201cThere are also dairy products, bread and meat without chemical additives at these markets. Organic food is not only much healthier but it tastes a lot better as well,\u201d explains Emma from Boston. So how about some healthy recipes for Thanksgiving? Maybe pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes? A roast turkey breast or a turkey roulade filled with apples and cranberries is delicious too. But there\u2019s more to a healthy lifestyle than just food. A lot of trend sports show that you can have fun, spend time with friends and stay fit at the same time. Have you found the right sport for you yet? If not, here is a suggestion: How about standup paddleboarding? If you like water, that\u2019s the ideal kind of sport for you. You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: \u201cDrinking too much alcohol isn\u2019t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?\u201d Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don\u2019t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion   A first date Dylan often thought about Abby. He really liked her. But he was too shy to ask her out on a date. Dylan\u2019s friend Forget her. She\u2019s not interested in you. She has a boyfriend.

When Dylan went to the gym, the boys attacked him. Scott pushed him really hard and Dylan couldn\u2019t do anything about it. Scott Stay away from her! Abby Stop it! You\u2019re hurting him!

I was so bored that I turned their music off and played some hip-hop 2 instead. Everybody was mad and shouted at me. I laughed at them and left. I hate this place and I hate these people. How can birds be so loud? Some of them started singing at four in the morning! Later the church bells 3 rang 4 . Nothing happened today. Just another boring day. When can I go home? Nothing! Aunt Susan wanted me to help with the cows and in the garden, but I stayed in my room and watched films. The village boys tried to pick me up for a football game. I told them that I didn\u2019t have my football shoes and couldn\u2019t play. I can\u2019t believe what happened last night. I woke up in the middle of the night because there was a loud noise in the house. I went to the kitchen and saw Aunt Susan there. She was on the phone, and she was very excited. When she saw me, she told me to come with her. Rosalie needed help. I didn\u2019t know who Rosalie was. I was surprised when I saw that Rosalie was one of Aunt Susan\u2019s cows. She needed help with her calf. Some other people from the village were there too. They were all very calm and knew what to do. They told me to hold the light so that the vet could see well. I could hardly look. That noise! And it smelt terrible. Yuck! 5 Then it was there. A little calf. So sweet, so clumsy. We all felt very happy. I was so tired but so excited. I got up early again. I just had to see if the calf was OK. It was. It stood next to Rosalie and drank its milk. It\u2019s the most beautiful little cow I\u2019ve ever seen 6 . I think I\u2019ll ask Aunt Susan if I can come back again. I think it\u2019s not that bad here. ___ 1 barbecue \u2013 Grillparty ; 2 hip-hop \u2013 Hip Hop (Musikrichtung) ; 3 bell \u2013 die Glocke ; 4 ring \u2013 l\u00e4uten ; 5 yuck \u2013 igitt 6 the most beautiful cow I\u2019ve ever seen \u2013 die sch\u00f6nste Kuh, die ich je gesehen habe"}

Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy \u2013 after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world\u2019s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren\u2019t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is \u2018fracking\u2019, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, \u201cFracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.\u201d But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada\u2019s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the end of this yet,\u201d says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. \u201cCO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.\u201d 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven\u2019t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won\u2019t change. \u201cWhat worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.\u201d Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable \u2013 which means that when we have used them up, there simply won\u2019t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada\u2019s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better \u2013 and we will have to.   The sound of ice I\u2019m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn\u2019t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship\u2019s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the \u2018northwest passage\u2019, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn\u2019t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship\u2019s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It\u2019s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn\u2019t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we\u2019d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn\u2019t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn\u2019t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back\u2019s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can\u2019t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let\u2019s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I\u2019m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown.

I thought it was a magical city with a very special atmosphere. It\u2019s small enough to get around easily and not feel lost, but big enough that there\u2019s a lot to do. So after I left school, I decided to go to university there. It was a good decision \u2013 I had a wonderful time! The locals were really friendly and after some time I even started to understand the Edinburgh accent. In fact, I loved Edinburgh so much that I stayed after university. At first I lived and worked in the city, but after I met my husband (who is a true Scotsman!) we moved to the countryside nearby. I work from home now as I have my own business. But I love to drive to the city at the weekend in my Mini. Last week my parents came to stay and we visited Edinburgh Castle and the Scottish National Gallery. One day we took the children to the zoo, and another day we took a boat out to Inchcolm Abbey on a nearby island. Most days we had a picnic lunch in the Princes Street Gardens.I love that there are so many different things to do in Edinburgh. This city really has become my home now.

Apart from its face, a chimp also uses body language to communicate. For example, its hair stands on end when it is excited. That reaction can also mean that it is afraid. When it is aggressive, it usually raises its arms or hits the ground and stares at another animal. A chimp normally produces more than 15 different types of call. For example, there is a special identification call that will help its family find it. When chimps play, they often make a sound similar to our laughter.

They decide to go on a trip to find the boy\u2019s body and prepare for the trip. The Gun My room was on the second floor, and it was really hot up there. I was glad I wasn\u2019t sleeping there that night, and the thought of where we were going made me excited again. I rolled up two blankets and tied an old belt around them. I grabbed all my money, which was less than a dollar. Then I was ready to go. I went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad. I was walking up Carbine Street towards the clubhouse when Chris caught up with me. His eyes were shining. \u201cGordie! You want to see something?\u201d \u201cSure. What?\u201d \u201cCome down here first.\u201d He pointed down an alley between two shops. \u201cWhat is it, Chris?\u201d \u201cCome on, I said!\u201d He ran down the alley and I ran after him. At the bottom, the smell from the trash was terrible. \u201cChris, I\u2019m going to puke, I\u2019m \u2013 \u201d But I forgot about the smell when Chris put his hand into his backpack and pulled out a big gun. \u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d \u201cFrom my dad\u2019s desk.\u201d \u201cMan, your dad\u2019s going to beat you when he finds out.\u201d Chris\u2019s eyes just went on dancing. \u201cHe isn\u2019t going to find out. He and his friends have got enough wine to keep them drunk for a week. I\u2019ll put it back before then.\u201d Chris hated alcohol \u2013 he\u2019d already seen too much of what it can do. He was the only one of us who didn\u2019t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they\u2019d stolen from their father. \u201cHave you got bullets for it?\u201d \u201cNine of them \u2013 all that was left in the box. He\u2019ll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.\u201d \u201cAny in it at the moment?\u201d \u201cNo, of course not. What do you think I am?\u201d I finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA \u2013 BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin \u2013 it was the work of an evil magician. \u201cWow!\u201d I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn\u2019t tell if he was amused or scared. \u201cYou did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!\u201d \u201cShut up! Let\u2019s go!\u201d I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. \u201cMan, it\u2019s a pity you couldn\u2019t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.\u201d \u201cYou knew there was a bullet in it, didn\u2019t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad\u2019s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.\u201d Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, \u201cWhat do you think we need a gun for?\u201d \u201cNothing, really,\u201d Chris said. \u201cExcept we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it\u2019s frightening out in the forest at night.\u201d Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?\u201d Teddy asked Vern. \u201cYeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it\u2019ll look as if we\u2019re there after dark.\u201d \u201cHey, man, great!\u201d I said, and slapped Vern on the back. For him, that was real thinking. He grinned. \u201cSo let\u2019s go,\u201d Teddy said. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly twelve already.\u201d Chris stood up and we gathered round him. \u201cWe\u2019ll walk across Beeman\u2019s field,\u201d he said, \u201cand then we\u2019ll get to the railway tracks and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.\u201d \u201cHow far is it, do you think?\u201d Teddy asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Chris. \u201cHarlow\u2019s big. We\u2019re going to have to walk at least twenty miles. Does that sound right to you, Gordie?\u201d \u201cYeah. Maybe more \u2013 thirty miles.\u201d \u201cCome on, you guys,\u201d Chris said, and picked up his backpack, blankets and water bottle.   Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? headline written by Pam Warner (published 07\/12\/16 in Health & Style ) author, date, source What is your Thanksgiving like? Turkey and pumpkin pie? American football on the sofa? In the last couple of years a new trend has become popular in the USA: More people like to eat better quality food and live a more active life. introduction It is slowly going out of fashion to live off convenience and frozen food. A number of people shop for organic food at special supermarkets instead. In some states farmers\u2019 markets offer a great variety of fresh vegetables and fruit from the region. \u201cThere are also dairy products, bread and meat without chemical additives at these markets. Organic food is not only much healthier but it tastes a lot better as well,\u201d explains Emma from Boston. So how about some healthy recipes for Thanksgiving? Maybe pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes? A roast turkey breast or a turkey roulade filled with apples and cranberries is delicious too. But there\u2019s more to a healthy lifestyle than just food. A lot of trend sports show that you can have fun, spend time with friends and stay fit at the same time. Have you found the right sport for you yet? If not, here is a suggestion: How about standup paddleboarding? If you like water, that\u2019s the ideal kind of sport for you. You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: \u201cDrinking too much alcohol isn\u2019t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?\u201d Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don\u2019t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion   A first date Dylan often thought about Abby.

Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy \u2013 after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world\u2019s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren\u2019t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is \u2018fracking\u2019, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, \u201cFracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.\u201d But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada\u2019s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the end of this yet,\u201d says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. \u201cCO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.\u201d 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven\u2019t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won\u2019t change. \u201cWhat worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.\u201d Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable \u2013 which means that when we have used them up, there simply won\u2019t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada\u2019s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better \u2013 and we will have to.   The sound of ice I\u2019m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn\u2019t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship\u2019s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the \u2018northwest passage\u2019, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn\u2019t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship\u2019s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It\u2019s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn\u2019t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we\u2019d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn\u2019t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn\u2019t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back\u2019s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can\u2019t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let\u2019s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I\u2019m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown.

Best wishes, \u2026    The Titanic disaster The Belfast News Wednesday, 17th April 1912 TWO DAYS AFTER \u2013 MORE FACTS The giant ship Titanic, which was built here in Belfast\u2019s shipyard, hit an iceberg on 14th April, shortly before midnight. Water filled the ship until it sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD\u2019S LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship\u2019s builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. LOCAL MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland. The ship\u2019s doctor, Dr John Simpson, 37, was born in Belfast. His mother was optimistic when a letter from him arrived at her home yesterday. However, we have found out that he posted the letter during the ship\u2019s last stop. We now know that Dr Simpson did not survive. DOG SAVES LIVES Some were lucky and the ships which came to save the passengers of the Titanic found their lifeboat. According to a passenger, one of the dogs on board saved the lives of the people in one lifeboat. A ship only found this lifeboat in the dark night and the foggy weather because they heard the dog when it barked. HOW COULD IT HAPPEN? After the sinking of the Titanic a number of questions still need answers. Why did no one see the iceberg? Why did the ship break? Why were there only 20 lifeboats for 2,200 people on board? Why did lifeboats leave the ship when they were not yet full? And how can we make sure that an accident like this will never happen again? About 700 people survived the accident. Some ships today have over 6,500 passengers and crew. After the Titanic\u2019s accident there were laws that ships must have one lifeboat place for every person on board. Dr Simpson\u2019s last letter to his mother is now in the Belfast Titanic museum.   A deadly silence 1. My name is Jonas Fox and I\u2019m twelve years old. I work in the mines and my job is to sit near a door in the tunnel every day. I must open the door when the coal arrives. Then, after it\u2019s gone, I quickly close the door again. Every day I sit in the dark, but I\u2019m never scared. That\u2019s because my friend Billy is always there with me. Billy sings all day long. He\u2019s yellow with little black eyes which look like they are made of glass. Billy is a canary, you see? It\u2019s never boring with Billy around. I would love to sing too, but I can\u2019t even talk. 2. Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine killed 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there\u2019s gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine. One day Bart started to cough and he never stopped coughing after that. Then one night my brother coughed so badly that he died. That was when I stopped talking. I don\u2019t know why, really. I still had words in my head and I opened my mouth, but I couldn\u2019t speak. The men in the mine started to call me \u2018Silent Jonas\u2019 after that. They probably thought I was a bit strange. 4. The day when things got really bad started like any other. Billy was singing like he always did. I heard the people in the tunnels and the noise of the coal trucks. I opened the door and I felt a cold wind in the tunnel. I closed the door again. Billy stopped singing. For a moment I didn\u2019t understand. But then, suddenly, I did: There was gas in the mine! And it could explode any second. I didn\u2019t have time to run down the tunnel to warn the men. If only I could talk, if only I could shout! 5. I knew I had to warn everyone in the mine. So I opened my mouth and tried to say it: \u201cGas.\u201d But there was no sound. Nothing came out. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth again. Nothing. I panicked. We could die in here \u2013 I had to speak! I tried again. This time the sound was quiet, but I made a sound. At last! I opened the door and shouted, \u201cGas. Gas. GAS!\u201d A moment later I heard the sound of the miners\u2019 boots in the tunnels. I took Billy\u2019s cage and ran too. 6. I ran through the tunnel as fast as I could. But my head hurt and I couldn\u2019t breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn\u2019t tell where it was coming from. \u201cCome on, boy!\u201d it said. Somebody picked me up. I turned around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy\u2019s cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn\u2019t just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, \u201cWho warned us?\u201d \u201cMe!\u201d I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. \u201cSilent Jonas found his voice!\u201d a miner shouted. But how could I feel happy? My friend Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small \u2018Tweet\u2019. Billy was alive! I opened the cage \u2026 There were canaries in mines until 1987. Today miners use machines to find out if there is gas in the mine.   The Norman conquest The old king of England, Edward, died in 1066. He had no children and both his Anglo-Saxon brother-in-law, Harold, and his French cousin, William, Duke of Normandy, wanted to be the next king of England. Harold made himself king, and William was very angry. So what did he do next? He sailed to England with his army \u2026 Harold and William fought the battle on Senlac Hill, near Hastings. William\u2019s men were knights and they were better trained. They fought on horses and were good archers. Harold\u2019s men fought on foot and they were already tired from an earlier battle at Stamford Bridge, 200 miles away in the north of England. (Yes, they had to walk those 200 miles!) How do we know what happened during the Battle of Hastings? Well, we have the 70-metre long Bayeux Tapestry to tell us! The tapestry is like a comic and it tells the story of the battle. It tells us that Harold died when he got an arrow in his eye, but we don\u2019t know if this really happened. William won the Battle of Hastings and he became king of England on Christmas Day 1066. Today we know him as William the Conqueror. He was a big castle fan and built lots of them in England, including part of the Tower of London. He also took land from the Anglo-Saxons and gave it to his Norman friends. Did the Normans change England? Yes, of course they did! For example, they brought many new words to the English language. Words like \u2018pork\u2019 and \u2018garden\u2019 come from this time. Guess what? There are still many English people who have Norman surnames, like Archer or Darcy. Before the Normans came to England, most people didn\u2019t even have surnames. They lived in small villages, so a first name or a nickname was often enough. ___ conquest \u2013 Eroberung ; the Anglo-Saxons \u2013 die Angelsachsen (das Volk, das schon vor 1066 in England lebte) ; brother-in-law \u2013 Schwager ; duke \u2013 Herzog ; army \u2013 Heer; Armee ; knight \u2013 Ritter ; archer \u2013 Bogensch\u00fctze; Bogensch\u00fctzin ; tapestry \u2013 Wandteppich ; surname \u2013 Nachname; Familienname   The RNLI: Volunteers on the coast The RNLI is the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. It\u2019s a charity and it saves lives at sea. The RNLI has 237 lifeboat stations and about 4,600 crew members in the UK and Ireland. The RNLI rescues about 8,000 people per year. The RNLI has saved about 140,000 lives since 1824. Many of the lifeboat crew members are volunteers. The RNLI gets money from fundraising. 18th June 2016, by Simon Spade Yesterday the RNLI rescued two teenage boys who got into trouble when they were kayaking off the coast near Llandudno. The two 14-year-old boys went out too far in their kayaks and could not get back to the beach because of strong winds. They tried to get back for more than two and a half hours, then shouted for help and waved. A tourist spotted the boys and made an emergency call to the RNLI. The lifeboat crew left their station at 1:40 p.m. and got to the kayaks in only a few minutes. The RNLI crew picked up the boys and gave them blankets and hot drinks to keep them warm. Lifeboat helm Howard Link called the ambulance to meet them on the beach. Both boys were very weak and seasick. They both spent the night in Llandudno hospital but are back home now. The lifeboat crew got back to their station at 3:25 p.m. There are some rules to remember when you go to the beach: S pot the dangers. A lways go with a friend or adult.

It grins or sneers to show it is excited or afraid. It presses its lips together if it wants to impress another chimp. When it plays, a chimp generally has an open smile with its top teeth covered. Apart from its face, a chimp also uses body language to communicate. For example, its hair stands on end when it is excited. That reaction can also mean that it is afraid. When it is aggressive, it usually raises its arms or hits the ground and stares at another animal. A chimp normally produces more than 15 different types of call. For example, there is a special identification call that will help its family find it. When chimps play, they often make a sound similar to our laughter. Body contact is very important for preserving harmony in a group of chimpanzees. That is why chimpanzees often groom each other for hours. It helps them stay calm and creates feelings of friendship.

The Titanic disaster The Belfast News Wednesday, 17th April 1912 TWO DAYS AFTER \u2013 MORE FACTS The giant ship Titanic, which was built here in Belfast\u2019s shipyard, hit an iceberg on 14th April, shortly before midnight. Water filled the ship until it sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD\u2019S LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship\u2019s builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. LOCAL MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland. The ship\u2019s doctor, Dr John Simpson, 37, was born in Belfast. His mother was optimistic when a letter from him arrived at her home yesterday. However, we have found out that he posted the letter during the ship\u2019s last stop. We now know that Dr Simpson did not survive. DOG SAVES LIVES Some were lucky and the ships which came to save the passengers of the Titanic found their lifeboat. According to a passenger, one of the dogs on board saved the lives of the people in one lifeboat. A ship only found this lifeboat in the dark night and the foggy weather because they heard the dog when it barked. HOW COULD IT HAPPEN? After the sinking of the Titanic a number of questions still need answers. Why did no one see the iceberg? Why did the ship break? Why were there only 20 lifeboats for 2,200 people on board? Why did lifeboats leave the ship when they were not yet full? And how can we make sure that an accident like this will never happen again? About 700 people survived the accident. Some ships today have over 6,500 passengers and crew. After the Titanic\u2019s accident there were laws that ships must have one lifeboat place for every person on board. Dr Simpson\u2019s last letter to his mother is now in the Belfast Titanic museum.   A deadly silence 1. My name is Jonas Fox and I\u2019m twelve years old. I work in the mines and my job is to sit near a door in the tunnel every day. I must open the door when the coal arrives. Then, after it\u2019s gone, I quickly close the door again. Every day I sit in the dark, but I\u2019m never scared. That\u2019s because my friend Billy is always there with me. Billy sings all day long. He\u2019s yellow with little black eyes which look like they are made of glass. Billy is a canary, you see? It\u2019s never boring with Billy around. I would love to sing too, but I can\u2019t even talk. 2. Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine killed 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there\u2019s gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine. One day Bart started to cough and he never stopped coughing after that. Then one night my brother coughed so badly that he died. That was when I stopped talking. I don\u2019t know why, really. I still had words in my head and I opened my mouth, but I couldn\u2019t speak. The men in the mine started to call me \u2018Silent Jonas\u2019 after that. They probably thought I was a bit strange. 4. The day when things got really bad started like any other. Billy was singing like he always did. I heard the people in the tunnels and the noise of the coal trucks. I opened the door and I felt a cold wind in the tunnel. I closed the door again. Billy stopped singing. For a moment I didn\u2019t understand. But then, suddenly, I did: There was gas in the mine! And it could explode any second. I didn\u2019t have time to run down the tunnel to warn the men. If only I could talk, if only I could shout! 5. I knew I had to warn everyone in the mine. So I opened my mouth and tried to say it: \u201cGas.\u201d But there was no sound. Nothing came out. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth again. Nothing. I panicked. We could die in here \u2013 I had to speak! I tried again. This time the sound was quiet, but I made a sound. At last! I opened the door and shouted, \u201cGas. Gas. GAS!\u201d A moment later I heard the sound of the miners\u2019 boots in the tunnels. I took Billy\u2019s cage and ran too. 6. I ran through the tunnel as fast as I could. But my head hurt and I couldn\u2019t breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn\u2019t tell where it was coming from. \u201cCome on, boy!\u201d it said. Somebody picked me up. I turned around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy\u2019s cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn\u2019t just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, \u201cWho warned us?\u201d \u201cMe!\u201d I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. \u201cSilent Jonas found his voice!\u201d a miner shouted. But how could I feel happy? My friend Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small \u2018Tweet\u2019. Billy was alive! I opened the cage \u2026 There were canaries in mines until 1987. Today miners use machines to find out if there is gas in the mine.   The Norman conquest The old king of England, Edward, died in 1066. He had no children and both his Anglo-Saxon brother-in-law, Harold, and his French cousin, William, Duke of Normandy, wanted to be the next king of England. Harold made himself king, and William was very angry. So what did he do next? He sailed to England with his army \u2026 Harold and William fought the battle on Senlac Hill, near Hastings. William\u2019s men were knights and they were better trained. They fought on horses and were good archers. Harold\u2019s men fought on foot and they were already tired from an earlier battle at Stamford Bridge, 200 miles away in the north of England. (Yes, they had to walk those 200 miles!) How do we know what happened during the Battle of Hastings? Well, we have the 70-metre long Bayeux Tapestry to tell us! The tapestry is like a comic and it tells the story of the battle. It tells us that Harold died when he got an arrow in his eye, but we don\u2019t know if this really happened. William won the Battle of Hastings and he became king of England on Christmas Day 1066. Today we know him as William the Conqueror. He was a big castle fan and built lots of them in England, including part of the Tower of London. He also took land from the Anglo-Saxons and gave it to his Norman friends. Did the Normans change England? Yes, of course they did! For example, they brought many new words to the English language. Words like \u2018pork\u2019 and \u2018garden\u2019 come from this time. Guess what? There are still many English people who have Norman surnames, like Archer or Darcy. Before the Normans came to England, most people didn\u2019t even have surnames. They lived in small villages, so a first name or a nickname was often enough. ___ conquest \u2013 Eroberung ; the Anglo-Saxons \u2013 die Angelsachsen (das Volk, das schon vor 1066 in England lebte) ; brother-in-law \u2013 Schwager ; duke \u2013 Herzog ; army \u2013 Heer; Armee ; knight \u2013 Ritter ; archer \u2013 Bogensch\u00fctze; Bogensch\u00fctzin ; tapestry \u2013 Wandteppich ; surname \u2013 Nachname; Familienname   The RNLI: Volunteers on the coast The RNLI is the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. It\u2019s a charity and it saves lives at sea. The RNLI has 237 lifeboat stations and about 4,600 crew members in the UK and Ireland. The RNLI rescues about 8,000 people per year. The RNLI has saved about 140,000 lives since 1824. Many of the lifeboat crew members are volunteers. The RNLI gets money from fundraising. 18th June 2016, by Simon Spade Yesterday the RNLI rescued two teenage boys who got into trouble when they were kayaking off the coast near Llandudno. The two 14-year-old boys went out too far in their kayaks and could not get back to the beach because of strong winds. They tried to get back for more than two and a half hours, then shouted for help and waved. A tourist spotted the boys and made an emergency call to the RNLI. The lifeboat crew left their station at 1:40 p.m. and got to the kayaks in only a few minutes. The RNLI crew picked up the boys and gave them blankets and hot drinks to keep them warm. Lifeboat helm Howard Link called the ambulance to meet them on the beach. Both boys were very weak and seasick. They both spent the night in Llandudno hospital but are back home now. The lifeboat crew got back to their station at 3:25 p.m. There are some rules to remember when you go to the beach: S pot the dangers. A lways go with a friend or adult. F ind and follow the safety signs and flags. E mergency \u2013 put up your hand and shout or call 999\/112. Most lifeboat crew members are volunteers. Let\u2019s meet some.

I thought it was a magical city with a very special atmosphere. It\u2019s small enough to get around easily and not feel lost, but big enough that there\u2019s a lot to do. So after I left school, I decided to go to university there. It was a good decision \u2013 I had a wonderful time! The locals were really friendly and after some time I even started to understand the Edinburgh accent. In fact, I loved Edinburgh so much that I stayed after university. At first I lived and worked in the city, but after I met my husband (who is a true Scotsman!) we moved to the countryside nearby. I work from home now as I have my own business. But I love to drive to the city at the weekend in my Mini. Last week my parents came to stay and we visited Edinburgh Castle and the Scottish National Gallery. One day we took the children to the zoo, and another day we took a boat out to Inchcolm Abbey on a nearby island. Most days we had a picnic lunch in the Princes Street Gardens.I love that there are so many different things to do in Edinburgh. This city really has become my home now. I couldn\u2019t imagine moving away! Answer the question in a full sentence: Why did Caroline move to Edinburgh? (\"She moved to Edinburgh to study and because she loved the city.\u201d)"}

Water filled the ship until it sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD\u2019S LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship\u2019s builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. LOCAL MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland. The ship\u2019s doctor, Dr John Simpson, 37, was born in Belfast. His mother was optimistic when a letter from him arrived at her home yesterday. However, we have found out that he posted the letter during the ship\u2019s last stop. We now know that Dr Simpson did not survive. DOG SAVES LIVES Some were lucky and the ships which came to save the passengers of the Titanic found their lifeboat. According to a passenger, one of the dogs on board saved the lives of the people in one lifeboat. A ship only found this lifeboat in the dark night and the foggy weather because they heard the dog when it barked. HOW COULD IT HAPPEN? After the sinking of the Titanic a number of questions still need answers. Why did no one see the iceberg? Why did the ship break? Why were there only 20 lifeboats for 2,200 people on board? Why did lifeboats leave the ship when they were not yet full? And how can we make sure that an accident like this will never happen again? About 700 people survived the accident. Some ships today have over 6,500 passengers and crew. After the Titanic\u2019s accident there were laws that ships must have one lifeboat place for every person on board. Dr Simpson\u2019s last letter to his mother is now in the Belfast Titanic museum.   A deadly silence 1. My name is Jonas Fox and I\u2019m twelve years old.

Every day I sit in the dark, but I\u2019m never scared. That\u2019s because my friend Billy is always there with me. Billy sings all day long. He\u2019s yellow with little black eyes which look like they are made of glass. Billy is a canary, you see? It\u2019s never boring with Billy around. I would love to sing too, but I can\u2019t even talk. 2. Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine killed 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there\u2019s gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine. One day Bart started to cough and he never stopped coughing after that. Then one night my brother coughed so badly that he died. That was when I stopped talking. I don\u2019t know why, really. I still had words in my head and I opened my mouth, but I couldn\u2019t speak. The men in the mine started to call me \u2018Silent Jonas\u2019 after that. They probably thought I was a bit strange. 4. The day when things got really bad started like any other. Billy was singing like he always did. I heard the people in the tunnels and the noise of the coal trucks. I opened the door and I felt a cold wind in the tunnel. I closed the door again. Billy stopped singing. For a moment I didn\u2019t understand. But then, suddenly, I did: There was gas in the mine! And it could explode any second. I didn\u2019t have time to run down the tunnel to warn the men. If only I could talk, if only I could shout! 5. I knew I had to warn everyone in the mine. So I opened my mouth and tried to say it: \u201cGas.\u201d But there was no sound. Nothing came out. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth again. Nothing. I panicked. We could die in here \u2013 I had to speak! I tried again. This time the sound was quiet, but I made a sound. At last! I opened the door and shouted, \u201cGas. Gas. GAS!\u201d A moment later I heard the sound of the miners\u2019 boots in the tunnels. I took Billy\u2019s cage and ran too. 6. I ran through the tunnel as fast as I could. But my head hurt and I couldn\u2019t breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn\u2019t tell where it was coming from. \u201cCome on, boy!\u201d it said. Somebody picked me up. I turned around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy\u2019s cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn\u2019t just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, \u201cWho warned us?\u201d \u201cMe!\u201d I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. \u201cSilent Jonas found his voice!\u201d a miner shouted. But how could I feel happy? My friend Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small \u2018Tweet\u2019. Billy was alive! I opened the cage \u2026 There were canaries in mines until 1987. Today miners use machines to find out if there is gas in the mine.   The Norman conquest The old king of England, Edward, died in 1066. He had no children and both his Anglo-Saxon brother-in-law, Harold, and his French cousin, William, Duke of Normandy, wanted to be the next king of England. Harold made himself king, and William was very angry. So what did he do next? He sailed to England with his army \u2026 Harold and William fought the battle on Senlac Hill, near Hastings. William\u2019s men were knights and they were better trained. They fought on horses and were good archers. Harold\u2019s men fought on foot and they were already tired from an earlier battle at Stamford Bridge, 200 miles away in the north of England. (Yes, they had to walk those 200 miles!) How do we know what happened during the Battle of Hastings? Well, we have the 70-metre long Bayeux Tapestry to tell us! The tapestry is like a comic and it tells the story of the battle. It tells us that Harold died when he got an arrow in his eye, but we don\u2019t know if this really happened. William won the Battle of Hastings and he became king of England on Christmas Day 1066. Today we know him as William the Conqueror. He was a big castle fan and built lots of them in England, including part of the Tower of London. He also took land from the Anglo-Saxons and gave it to his Norman friends. Did the Normans change England? Yes, of course they did! For example, they brought many new words to the English language. Words like \u2018pork\u2019 and \u2018garden\u2019 come from this time. Guess what? There are still many English people who have Norman surnames, like Archer or Darcy. Before the Normans came to England, most people didn\u2019t even have surnames. They lived in small villages, so a first name or a nickname was often enough. ___ conquest \u2013 Eroberung ; the Anglo-Saxons \u2013 die Angelsachsen (das Volk, das schon vor 1066 in England lebte) ; brother-in-law \u2013 Schwager ; duke \u2013 Herzog ; army \u2013 Heer; Armee ; knight \u2013 Ritter ; archer \u2013 Bogensch\u00fctze; Bogensch\u00fctzin ; tapestry \u2013 Wandteppich ; surname \u2013 Nachname; Familienname   The RNLI: Volunteers on the coast The RNLI is the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. It\u2019s a charity and it saves lives at sea. The RNLI has 237 lifeboat stations and about 4,600 crew members in the UK and Ireland. The RNLI rescues about 8,000 people per year. The RNLI has saved about 140,000 lives since 1824. Many of the lifeboat crew members are volunteers. The RNLI gets money from fundraising. 18th June 2016, by Simon Spade Yesterday the RNLI rescued two teenage boys who got into trouble when they were kayaking off the coast near Llandudno. The two 14-year-old boys went out too far in their kayaks and could not get back to the beach because of strong winds. They tried to get back for more than two and a half hours, then shouted for help and waved. A tourist spotted the boys and made an emergency call to the RNLI. The lifeboat crew left their station at 1:40 p.m. and got to the kayaks in only a few minutes. The RNLI crew picked up the boys and gave them blankets and hot drinks to keep them warm. Lifeboat helm Howard Link called the ambulance to meet them on the beach. Both boys were very weak and seasick. They both spent the night in Llandudno hospital but are back home now. The lifeboat crew got back to their station at 3:25 p.m. There are some rules to remember when you go to the beach: S pot the dangers. A lways go with a friend or adult. F ind and follow the safety signs and flags. E mergency \u2013 put up your hand and shout or call 999\/112. Most lifeboat crew members are volunteers. Let\u2019s meet some. Name: Howard Link Job: Postman Lifeboat helm: I lead the rescue. It is my job to make sure that everyone on the boat stays safe while we are at sea. Name: Susan Merchant Job: Teacher Lifeboat crew member: I grew up in Wales near the sea, so I have been in boats for many years. I help during the rescue and look after the rescued person. Name: John Taylor Job: Student Lifeboat youth volunteer: I\u2019m only 16 so I\u2019m too young to join the lifeboat crew, but I work at the station. I look after the equipment and help at fundraising events.

He\u2019ll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.\u201d \u201cAny in it at the moment?\u201d \u201cNo, of course not. What do you think I am?\u201d I finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA \u2013 BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin \u2013 it was the work of an evil magician. \u201cWow!\u201d I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn\u2019t tell if he was amused or scared. \u201cYou did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!\u201d \u201cShut up! Let\u2019s go!\u201d I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. \u201cMan, it\u2019s a pity you couldn\u2019t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.\u201d \u201cYou knew there was a bullet in it, didn\u2019t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad\u2019s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.\u201d Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, \u201cWhat do you think we need a gun for?\u201d \u201cNothing, really,\u201d Chris said. \u201cExcept we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it\u2019s frightening out in the forest at night.\u201d Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?\u201d Teddy asked Vern. \u201cYeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it\u2019ll look as if we\u2019re there after dark.\u201d \u201cHey, man, great!\u201d I said, and slapped Vern on the back. For him, that was real thinking. He grinned. \u201cSo let\u2019s go,\u201d Teddy said. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly twelve already.\u201d Chris stood up and we gathered round him. \u201cWe\u2019ll walk across Beeman\u2019s field,\u201d he said, \u201cand then we\u2019ll get to the railway tracks and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.\u201d \u201cHow far is it, do you think?\u201d Teddy asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Chris. \u201cHarlow\u2019s big. We\u2019re going to have to walk at least twenty miles. Does that sound right to you, Gordie?\u201d \u201cYeah. Maybe more \u2013 thirty miles.\u201d \u201cCome on, you guys,\u201d Chris said, and picked up his backpack, blankets and water bottle.   Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? headline written by Pam Warner (published 07\/12\/16 in Health & Style ) author, date, source What is your Thanksgiving like? Turkey and pumpkin pie? American football on the sofa? In the last couple of years a new trend has become popular in the USA: More people like to eat better quality food and live a more active life. introduction It is slowly going out of fashion to live off convenience and frozen food. A number of people shop for organic food at special supermarkets instead. In some states farmers\u2019 markets offer a great variety of fresh vegetables and fruit from the region. \u201cThere are also dairy products, bread and meat without chemical additives at these markets. Organic food is not only much healthier but it tastes a lot better as well,\u201d explains Emma from Boston. So how about some healthy recipes for Thanksgiving? Maybe pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes? A roast turkey breast or a turkey roulade filled with apples and cranberries is delicious too. But there\u2019s more to a healthy lifestyle than just food. A lot of trend sports show that you can have fun, spend time with friends and stay fit at the same time. Have you found the right sport for you yet? If not, here is a suggestion: How about standup paddleboarding? If you like water, that\u2019s the ideal kind of sport for you. You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: \u201cDrinking too much alcohol isn\u2019t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?\u201d Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don\u2019t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion   A first date Dylan often thought about Abby. He really liked her. But he was too shy to ask her out on a date. Dylan\u2019s friend Forget her. She\u2019s not interested in you. She has a boyfriend. One day his books fell out of his locker right when Abby showed up. With Scott in tow, of course. How embarrassing. Scott Who\u2019s that guy? Look at him! A few days later they had lunch together. Dylan helped Abby with her Science project. They didn\u2019t notice Scott and his football friends. Scott\u2019s friend Isn\u2019t she your girlfriend? Dylan Let me explain. It\u2019s not that hard! When Dylan went to the gym, the boys attacked him. Scott pushed him really hard and Dylan couldn\u2019t do anything about it. Scott Stay away from her! Abby Stop it! You\u2019re hurting him! A few days later Dylan asked Abby, \u201cSo, are you coming to the dance with me?\u201d And she said yes. He was very nervous when he picked her up. Abby\u2019s dad So, young man, you must be Dylan. The party was great. Everybody enjoyed the music and dancing. There was a big surprise that evening. Dylan and Abby were so proud. Presenter We proudly present this year\u2019s Homecoming King and Queen. At the end of the evening Dylan took Abby home. There it was, the perfect moment. But \u2026 Abby\u2019s dad Excuse me?   Living the dream? Interviewer Hello Jos\u00e9. Can I ask you a few questions for our magazine, please? Jos\u00e9 Hi. Sure. Interviewer You\u2019re new on the baseball team. Are you happy? Jos\u00e9 We won the first three matches, so I can\u2019t complain. Interviewer There are lots of players from Latin America here. When did you immigrate to the United States? Jos\u00e9 That was twelve years ago. I was ten. Interviewer That was a big decision for your parents. They left their home and moved to a foreign place. Jos\u00e9 Yes, but they were very poor in Cuba. My father had been unemployed for a long time. My parents wanted to give me and my sisters the best chances. Interviewer What were the first years like? Jos\u00e9 My parents had problems because they hadn\u2019t learned English in school. But there\u2019s a strong community of Cubans here in New York. So my parents opened a small shop for other immigrants. Interviewer And how did you feel? Jos\u00e9 At the beginning I was homesick. I missed my friends. But my parents had given up a lot for me and I slowly got used to my new life. Interviewer When did you begin your baseball career? Jos\u00e9 Before I was 15, I hadn\u2019t taken any sports seriously. Then I joined the baseball team in high school and we were very successful. After I had become the star of my team, my baseball career started. I\u2019ve been very lucky. I can live my dream. For most people it\u2019s much harder. Interviewer What about your plans for the future? Jos\u00e9 I\u2019m a US citizen now and my home is here. But I plan to help people in Cuba. Interviewer Thank you for your time.   Too young to work? Many big farms in California employ children, mostly from Latin America, to pick fruit or vegetables. Children have to help their parents earn their living because migrant parents often don\u2019t have enough income. It is difficult for them to get a better job because many of them don\u2019t have many qualifications or can hardly speak English. Some are even in the USA illegally. All laborers have the legal right to take breaks and get water to drink in the state of California. But in reality things are different. Fresno Weekly Magazine talked to Matteo (12) and his brother Ramon (14) from Sacramento, who have been working on different farms. Fresno Weekly What are the working conditions like for you? Matteo We have to get up at 4:30 in the morning. Buses drive us to the fields, where we work all day in the heat. We sometimes work more than ten hours a day and only earn the minimum wage or even less. The long hours in the fields make you tired. Fresno Weekly Ramon, how long have you been working in the fields? Ramon Since I was ten, just like my Dad. Fresno Weekly Do you have any health problems? Ramon Yes, because of the pesticides I always have difficulty breathing and I have a constant headache out there. But that\u2019s not all. Some people get injured working with the large machines. A federal law from 1938 allows farm owners to employ children from the age of twelve on big farms and even younger children on small farms. From the age of 14 teenagers can do farm work without their parents\u2019 consent. Officially, they are only allowed to work outside school hours, but some of them don\u2019t even finish high school. There are no statistics about how many children spend their days as farm helpers, but the estimate is about half a million. All recent attempts to change the law have failed."}
