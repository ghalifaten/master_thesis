**Abstract**
*With the increasing demand for digital learning and the advancement of machine learning techniques, automatic scoring methods keep evolving. Providing a formative feedback relies on determining the different aspects to assess in the studentâ€™s answer. This work suggests five different solutions to address the problem of automatically recommending the set of competencies to be evaluated in a given task. The solutions rely on topic modelling techniques, multi-label text classification (MLC), approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) on BERT word-embeddings and generative AI using GPT. The text-search method based on BERT and ANN outperforms the other solutions suggesting aspects that are similar to reality. The topic detection techniques are victim of the sparseness of short texts and MLC is
beated by the large number of labels in a small dataset. The GPT-based solution provides interesting results at the cost of prompt engineering and post-processing. This work represents a starting point to develop sophisticated systems to automate the generation of feedback on E-learning platforms.*
