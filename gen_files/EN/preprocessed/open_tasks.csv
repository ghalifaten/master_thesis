My great-grandmother. I would‚Äôve liked to have known her, a wild horse of a woman, so wild she wouldn‚Äôt marry. Until my great-grandfather threw a sack over her head and carried her off. Just like that, as if she were a fancy chandelier 2 . That‚Äôs the way he did it. And the story goes she never forgave him. She looked out the window her whole life, the way so many women sit their sadness on an elbow. I wonder if she made the best with what she got or was she sorry because she couldn‚Äôt be all the things she wanted to be. Esperanza. I have inherited her name, but I don‚Äôt want to inherit her place by the window. At school they say my name funny as if the syllables were made out of tin and hurt the roof of your mouth. But in Spanish my name is made out of a softer something, like silver, not quite as thick as my sister‚Äôs name ‚Äì Magdalena ‚Äì which is uglier than mine. Magdalena who at least can come home and become Nenny. But I am always Esperanza. I would like to baptize 3 myself under a new name, a name more like the real me, the one nobody sees.

He runs away. I always win! Silly dog! Ohh, what‚Äôs this? I can smell fish from across the road 7 . I love it! I find a piece of fish near the bins. The extra food is yummy! And it‚Äôs always time for food. Food ‚Ä¶ good idea. It‚Äôs 5:30 in the morning, and I‚Äôm tired and hungry. I meow loudly until one of the Harpers opens the door. They feed me and stroke me again.

I could hardly look. That noise! And it smelt terrible. Yuck! 5 Then it was there. A little calf. So sweet, so clumsy. We all felt very happy. I was so tired but so excited. I got up early again. I just had to see if the calf was OK. It was. It stood next to Rosalie and drank its milk. It‚Äôs the most beautiful little cow I‚Äôve ever seen 6 .

I want to be with my friends. But I‚Äôm not. Mum and Dad sent me to stay with Aunt Susan for six long days. To a village! In the middle of nowhere. All you can see are fields, trees and some animals. There are no shops, no caf√©s and no buses. No skate park either! It‚Äôs so boring! How can people live here? There was a party in the village this evening. But it wasn‚Äôt fun. There was a barbecue 1 and then singing and dancing. But the music was awful. I was so bored that I turned their music off and played some hip-hop 2 instead. Everybody was mad and shouted at me. I laughed at them and left. I hate this place and I hate these people. How can birds be so loud? Some of them started singing at four in the morning! Later the church bells 3 rang 4 . Nothing happened today. Just another boring day. When can I go home? Nothing! Aunt Susan wanted me to help with the cows and in the garden, but I stayed in my room and watched films. The village boys tried to pick me up for a football game. I told them that I didn‚Äôt have my football shoes and couldn‚Äôt play. I can‚Äôt believe what happened last night. I woke up in the middle of the night because there was a loud noise in the house. I went to the kitchen and saw Aunt Susan there. She was on the phone, and she was very excited.

Water filled the ship until it sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD‚ÄôS LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship‚Äôs builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. LOCAL MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland. The ship‚Äôs doctor, Dr John Simpson, 37, was born in Belfast. His mother was optimistic when a letter from him arrived at her home yesterday. However, we have found out that he posted the letter during the ship‚Äôs last stop. We now know that Dr Simpson did not survive. DOG SAVES LIVES Some were lucky and the ships which came to save the passengers of the Titanic found their lifeboat. According to a passenger, one of the dogs on board saved the lives of the people in one lifeboat. A ship only found this lifeboat in the dark night and the foggy weather because they heard the dog when it barked. HOW COULD IT HAPPEN? After the sinking of the Titanic a number of questions still need answers. Why did no one see the iceberg? Why did the ship break? Why were there only 20 lifeboats for 2,200 people on board? Why did lifeboats leave the ship when they were not yet full? And how can we make sure that an accident like this will never happen again? About 700 people survived the accident. Some ships today have over 6,500 passengers and crew. After the Titanic‚Äôs accident there were laws that ships must have one lifeboat place for every person on board.

Dr Simpson‚Äôs last letter to his mother is now in the Belfast Titanic museum.   A deadly silence 1. My name is Jonas Fox and I‚Äôm twelve years old. I work in the mines and my job is to sit near a door in the tunnel every day. I must open the door when the coal arrives. Then, after it‚Äôs gone, I quickly close the door again. Every day I sit in the dark, but I‚Äôm never scared. That‚Äôs because my friend Billy is always there with me. Billy sings all day long. He‚Äôs yellow with little black eyes which look like they are made of glass. Billy is a canary, you see? It‚Äôs never boring with Billy around. I would love to sing too, but I can‚Äôt even talk. 2. Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine killed 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there‚Äôs gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine. One day Bart started to cough and he never stopped coughing after that. Then one night my brother coughed so badly that he died. That was when I stopped talking. I don‚Äôt know why, really. I still had words in my head and I opened my mouth, but I couldn‚Äôt speak. The men in the mine started to call me ‚ÄòSilent Jonas‚Äô after that. They probably thought I was a bit strange. 4. The day when things got really bad started like any other. Billy was singing like he always did. I heard the people in the tunnels and the noise of the coal trucks. I opened the door and I felt a cold wind in the tunnel. I closed the door again. Billy stopped singing. For a moment I didn‚Äôt understand. But then, suddenly, I did: There was gas in the mine! And it could explode any second. I didn‚Äôt have time to run down the tunnel to warn the men. If only I could talk, if only I could shout! 5. I knew I had to warn everyone in the mine. So I opened my mouth and tried to say it: ‚ÄúGas.‚Äù But there was no sound. Nothing came out. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth again. Nothing. I panicked. We could die in here ‚Äì I had to speak! I tried again. This time the sound was quiet, but I made a sound. At last! I opened the door and shouted, ‚ÄúGas. Gas. GAS!‚Äù A moment later I heard the sound of the miners‚Äô boots in the tunnels. I took Billy‚Äôs cage and ran too. 6. I ran through the tunnel as fast as I could. But my head hurt and I couldn‚Äôt breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn‚Äôt tell where it was coming from. ‚ÄúCome on, boy!‚Äù it said. Somebody picked me up. I turned around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy‚Äôs cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn‚Äôt just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, ‚ÄúWho warned us?‚Äù ‚ÄúMe!‚Äù I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. ‚ÄúSilent Jonas found his voice!‚Äù a miner shouted. But how could I feel happy? My friend Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small ‚ÄòTweet‚Äô. Billy was alive! I opened the cage ‚Ä¶ There were canaries in mines until 1987. Today miners use machines to find out if there is gas in the mine. ",,15

Today miners use machines to find out if there is gas in the mine.   The Norman conquest The old king of England, Edward, died in 1066. He had no children and both his Anglo-Saxon brother-in-law, Harold, and his French cousin, William, Duke of Normandy, wanted to be the next king of England. Harold made himself king, and William was very angry. So what did he do next? He sailed to England with his army ‚Ä¶ Harold and William fought the battle on Senlac Hill, near Hastings. William‚Äôs men were knights and they were better trained. They fought on horses and were good archers. Harold‚Äôs men fought on foot and they were already tired from an earlier battle at Stamford Bridge, 200 miles away in the north of England. (Yes, they had to walk those 200 miles!) How do we know what happened during the Battle of Hastings? Well, we have the 70-metre long Bayeux Tapestry to tell us! The tapestry is like a comic and it tells the story of the battle. It tells us that Harold died when he got an arrow in his eye, but we don‚Äôt know if this really happened. William won the Battle of Hastings and he became king of England on Christmas Day 1066. Today we know him as William the Conqueror. He was a big castle fan and built lots of them in England, including part of the Tower of London. He also took land from the Anglo-Saxons and gave it to his Norman friends. Did the Normans change England? Yes, of course they did! For example, they brought many new words to the English language. Words like ‚Äòpork‚Äô and ‚Äògarden‚Äô come from this time. Guess what? There are still many English people who have Norman surnames, like Archer or Darcy. Before the Normans came to England, most people didn‚Äôt even have surnames. They lived in small villages, so a first name or a nickname was often enough. ___ conquest ‚Äì Eroberung ; the Anglo-Saxons ‚Äì die Angelsachsen (das Volk, das schon vor 1066 in England lebte) ; brother-in-law ‚Äì Schwager ; duke ‚Äì Herzog ; army ‚Äì Heer; Armee ; knight ‚Äì Ritter ; archer ‚Äì Bogensch√ºtze; Bogensch√ºtzin ; tapestry ‚Äì Wandteppich ; surname ‚Äì Nachname; Familienname ",,7

Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine killed 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there‚Äôs gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine. One day Bart started to cough and he never stopped coughing after that. Then one night my brother coughed so badly that he died. That was when I stopped talking. I don‚Äôt know why, really. I still had words in my head and I opened my mouth, but I couldn‚Äôt speak. The men in the mine started to call me ‚ÄòSilent Jonas‚Äô after that. They probably thought I was a bit strange. 4. The day when things got really bad started like any other. Billy was singing like he always did. I heard the people in the tunnels and the noise of the coal trucks. I opened the door and I felt a cold wind in the tunnel. I closed the door again. Billy stopped singing. For a moment I didn‚Äôt understand. But then, suddenly, I did: There was gas in the mine! And it could explode any second. I didn‚Äôt have time to run down the tunnel to warn the men. If only I could talk, if only I could shout! 5. I knew I had to warn everyone in the mine. So I opened my mouth and tried to say it: ‚ÄúGas.‚Äù But there was no sound. Nothing came out. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth again. Nothing. I panicked. We could die in here ‚Äì I had to speak! I tried again. This time the sound was quiet, but I made a sound. At last! I opened the door and shouted, ‚ÄúGas. Gas. GAS!‚Äù A moment later I heard the sound of the miners‚Äô boots in the tunnels. I took Billy‚Äôs cage and ran too. 6. I ran through the tunnel as fast as I could. But my head hurt and I couldn‚Äôt breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn‚Äôt tell where it was coming from. ‚ÄúCome on, boy!‚Äù it said. Somebody picked me up. I turned around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy‚Äôs cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn‚Äôt just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, ‚ÄúWho warned us?‚Äù ‚ÄúMe!‚Äù I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. ‚ÄúSilent Jonas found his voice!‚Äù a miner shouted. But how could I feel happy? My friend Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small ‚ÄòTweet‚Äô. Billy was alive! I opened the cage ‚Ä¶ There were canaries in mines until 1987. Today miners use machines to find out if there is gas in the mine.   The Norman conquest The old king of England, Edward, died in 1066. He had no children and both his Anglo-Saxon brother-in-law, Harold, and his French cousin, William, Duke of Normandy, wanted to be the next king of England. Harold made himself king, and William was very angry. So what did he do next? He sailed to England with his army ‚Ä¶ Harold and William fought the battle on Senlac Hill, near Hastings. William‚Äôs men were knights and they were better trained. They fought on horses and were good archers. Harold‚Äôs men fought on foot and they were already tired from an earlier battle at Stamford Bridge, 200 miles away in the north of England. (Yes, they had to walk those 200 miles!) How do we know what happened during the Battle of Hastings? Well, we have the 70-metre long Bayeux Tapestry to tell us! The tapestry is like a comic and it tells the story of the battle. It tells us that Harold died when he got an arrow in his eye, but we don‚Äôt know if this really happened. William won the Battle of Hastings and he became king of England on Christmas Day 1066. Today we know him as William the Conqueror. He was a big castle fan and built lots of them in England, including part of the Tower of London. He also took land from the Anglo-Saxons and gave it to his Norman friends. Did the Normans change England? Yes, of course they did! For example, they brought many new words to the English language. Words like ‚Äòpork‚Äô and ‚Äògarden‚Äô come from this time. Guess what? There are still many English people who have Norman surnames, like Archer or Darcy. Before the Normans came to England, most people didn‚Äôt even have surnames. They lived in small villages, so a first name or a nickname was often enough. ___ conquest ‚Äì Eroberung ; the Anglo-Saxons ‚Äì die Angelsachsen (das Volk, das schon vor 1066 in England lebte) ; brother-in-law ‚Äì Schwager ; duke ‚Äì Herzog ; army ‚Äì Heer; Armee ; knight ‚Äì Ritter ; archer ‚Äì Bogensch√ºtze; Bogensch√ºtzin ; tapestry ‚Äì Wandteppich ; surname ‚Äì Nachname; Familienname   The RNLI: Volunteers on the coast The RNLI is the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.

818,3050,8v2MiA48Dub6AyNbiUsOsM,EN,well realli strong good musician write text word give opinion reason think,"  The Titanic disaster The Belfast News Wednesday, 17th April 1912 TWO DAYS AFTER ‚Äì MORE FACTS The giant ship Titanic, which was built here in Belfast‚Äôs shipyard, hit an iceberg on 14th April, shortly before midnight. Water filled the ship until it sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD‚ÄôS LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship‚Äôs builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. LOCAL MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland. The ship‚Äôs doctor, Dr John Simpson, 37, was born in Belfast. His mother was optimistic when a letter from him arrived at her home yesterday. However, we have found out that he posted the letter during the ship‚Äôs last stop. We now know that Dr Simpson did not survive. DOG SAVES LIVES Some were lucky and the ships which came to save the passengers of the Titanic found their lifeboat. According to a passenger, one of the dogs on board saved the lives of the people in one lifeboat. A ship only found this lifeboat in the dark night and the foggy weather because they heard the dog when it barked. HOW COULD IT HAPPEN? After the sinking of the Titanic a number of questions still need answers. Why did no one see the iceberg? Why did the ship break? Why were there only 20 lifeboats for 2,200 people on board? Why did lifeboats leave the ship when they were not yet full? And how can we make sure that an accident like this will never happen again? About 700 people survived the accident. Some ships today have over 6,500 passengers and crew. After the Titanic‚Äôs accident there were laws that ships must have one lifeboat place for every person on board. Dr Simpson‚Äôs last letter to his mother is now in the Belfast Titanic museum.   A deadly silence 1. My name is Jonas Fox and I‚Äôm twelve years old.

I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA ‚Äì BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin ‚Äì it was the work of an evil magician. ‚ÄúWow!‚Äù I screamed.

I was glad I wasn‚Äôt sleeping there that night, and the thought of where we were going made me excited again. I rolled up two blankets and tied an old belt around them. I grabbed all my money, which was less than a dollar. Then I was ready to go. I went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad. I was walking up Carbine Street towards the clubhouse when Chris caught up with me. His eyes were shining. ‚ÄúGordie! You want to see something?‚Äù ‚ÄúSure. What?‚Äù ‚ÄúCome down here first.‚Äù He pointed down an alley between two shops. ‚ÄúWhat is it, Chris?‚Äù ‚ÄúCome on, I said!‚Äù He ran down the alley and I ran after him.

He‚Äôll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.‚Äù ‚ÄúAny in it at the moment?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, of course not. What do you think I am?‚Äù I finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA ‚Äì BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin ‚Äì it was the work of an evil magician. ‚ÄúWow!‚Äù I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn‚Äôt tell if he was amused or scared. ‚ÄúYou did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!‚Äù ‚ÄúShut up! Let‚Äôs go!‚Äù I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. ‚ÄúMan, it‚Äôs a pity you couldn‚Äôt see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou knew there was a bullet in it, didn‚Äôt you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.‚Äù ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad‚Äôs desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.‚Äù Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, ‚ÄúWhat do you think we need a gun for?‚Äù ‚ÄúNothing, really,‚Äù Chris said. ‚ÄúExcept we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it‚Äôs frightening out in the forest at night.‚Äù Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?‚Äù Teddy asked Vern. ‚ÄúYeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it‚Äôll look as if we‚Äôre there after dark.‚Äù ‚ÄúHey, man, great!‚Äù I said, and slapped Vern on the back. For him, that was real thinking. He grinned. ‚ÄúSo let‚Äôs go,‚Äù Teddy said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nearly twelve already.‚Äù Chris stood up and we gathered round him. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll walk across Beeman‚Äôs field,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand then we‚Äôll get to the railway tracks and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.‚Äù ‚ÄúHow far is it, do you think?‚Äù Teddy asked. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù said Chris. ‚ÄúHarlow‚Äôs big.

Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? headline written by Pam Warner (published 07/12/16 in Health & Style ) author, date, source What is your Thanksgiving like? Turkey and pumpkin pie? American football on the sofa? In the last couple of years a new trend has become popular in the USA: More people like to eat better quality food and live a more active life. introduction It is slowly going out of fashion to live off convenience and frozen food. A number of people shop for organic food at special supermarkets instead. In some states farmers‚Äô markets offer a great variety of fresh vegetables and fruit from the region. ‚ÄúThere are also dairy products, bread and meat without chemical additives at these markets. Organic food is not only much healthier but it tastes a lot better as well,‚Äù explains Emma from Boston. So how about some healthy recipes for Thanksgiving? Maybe pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes? A roast turkey breast or a turkey roulade filled with apples and cranberries is delicious too. But there‚Äôs more to a healthy lifestyle than just food. A lot of trend sports show that you can have fun, spend time with friends and stay fit at the same time. Have you found the right sport for you yet? If not, here is a suggestion: How about standup paddleboarding? If you like water, that‚Äôs the ideal kind of sport for you. You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don‚Äôt worry, you don‚Äôt have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: ‚ÄúDrinking too much alcohol isn‚Äôt good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?‚Äù Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don‚Äôt have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion   A first date Dylan often thought about Abby. He really liked her. But he was too shy to ask her out on a date. Dylan‚Äôs friend Forget her. She‚Äôs not interested in you. She has a boyfriend.

When Dylan went to the gym, the boys attacked him. Scott pushed him really hard and Dylan couldn‚Äôt do anything about it. Scott Stay away from her! Abby Stop it! You‚Äôre hurting him! A few days later Dylan asked Abby, ‚ÄúSo, are you coming to the dance with me?‚Äù And she said yes. He was very nervous when he picked her up. Abby‚Äôs dad So, young man, you must be Dylan.

Jos√© That was twelve years ago. I was ten. Interviewer That was a big decision for your parents. They left their home and moved to a foreign place. Jos√© Yes, but they were very poor in Cuba. My father had been unemployed for a long time. My parents wanted to give me and my sisters the best chances. Interviewer What were the first years like? Jos√© My parents had problems because they hadn‚Äôt learned English in school. But there‚Äôs a strong community of Cubans here in New York. So my parents opened a small shop for other immigrants. Interviewer And how did you feel? Jos√© At the beginning I was homesick. I missed my friends. But my parents had given up a lot for me and I slowly got used to my new life. Interviewer When did you begin your baseball career? Jos√© Before I was 15, I hadn‚Äôt taken any sports seriously. Then I joined the baseball team in high school and we were very successful. After I had become the star of my team, my baseball career started. I‚Äôve been very lucky. I can live my dream. For most people it‚Äôs much harder. Interviewer What about your plans for the future?

Many big farms in California employ children, mostly from Latin America, to pick fruit or vegetables. Children have to help their parents earn their living because migrant parents often don‚Äôt have enough income. It is difficult for them to get a better job because many of them don‚Äôt have many qualifications or can hardly speak English. Some are even in the USA illegally. All laborers have the legal right to take breaks and get water to drink in the state of California. But in reality things are different. Fresno Weekly Magazine talked to Matteo (12) and his brother Ramon (14) from Sacramento, who have been working on different farms. Fresno Weekly What are the working conditions like for you? Matteo We have to get up at 4:30 in the morning. Buses drive us to the fields, where we work all day in the heat. We sometimes work more than ten hours a day and only earn the minimum wage or even less. The long hours in the fields make you tired. Fresno Weekly Ramon, how long have you been working in the fields? Ramon Since I was ten, just like my Dad. Fresno Weekly Do you have any health problems? Ramon Yes, because of the pesticides I always have difficulty breathing and I have a constant headache out there. But that‚Äôs not all. Some people get injured working with the large machines. A federal law from 1938 allows farm owners to employ children from the age of twelve on big farms and even younger children on small farms. From the age of 14 teenagers can do farm work without their parents‚Äô consent. Officially, they are only allowed to work outside school hours, but some of them don‚Äôt even finish high school. There are no statistics about how many children spend their days as farm helpers, but the estimate is about half a million. All recent attempts to change the law have failed. ",,8

Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy ‚Äì after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world‚Äôs electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren‚Äôt available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is ‚Äòfracking‚Äô, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, ‚ÄúFracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.‚Äù But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada‚Äôs oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt seen the end of this yet,‚Äù says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. ‚ÄúCO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.‚Äù 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven‚Äôt stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won‚Äôt change. ‚ÄúWhat worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúIt will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.‚Äù Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable ‚Äì which means that when we have used them up, there simply won‚Äôt be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada‚Äôs energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better ‚Äì and we will have to. ",,7

We can do even better ‚Äì and we will have to.   The sound of ice I‚Äôm standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn‚Äôt have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship‚Äôs doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the ‚Äònorthwest passage‚Äô, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn‚Äôt mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship‚Äôs monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It‚Äôs a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn‚Äôt change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we‚Äôd only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn‚Äôt last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn‚Äôt make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back‚Äôs Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can‚Äôt be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let‚Äôs hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I‚Äôm taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown. Stephen Samuel Stanley ‚Äì ship‚Äôs doctor, HMS Erebus ",,6

Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy ‚Äì after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world‚Äôs electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren‚Äôt available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is ‚Äòfracking‚Äô, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, ‚ÄúFracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.‚Äù But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada‚Äôs oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt seen the end of this yet,‚Äù says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. ‚ÄúCO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.‚Äù 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven‚Äôt stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won‚Äôt change. ‚ÄúWhat worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúIt will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.‚Äù Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable ‚Äì which means that when we have used them up, there simply won‚Äôt be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada‚Äôs energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future.

They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won‚Äôt change. ‚ÄúWhat worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúIt will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.‚Äù Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable ‚Äì which means that when we have used them up, there simply won‚Äôt be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada‚Äôs energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better ‚Äì and we will have to.   The sound of ice I‚Äôm standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn‚Äôt have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship‚Äôs doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the ‚Äònorthwest passage‚Äô, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn‚Äôt mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship‚Äôs monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It‚Äôs a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn‚Äôt change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we‚Äôd only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn‚Äôt last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn‚Äôt make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back‚Äôs Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can‚Äôt be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let‚Äôs hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I‚Äôm taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown.

My English isn‚Äôt bad and I used to work as a babysitter for our neighbours‚Äô kids. I could choose to work from four weeks to ten months. I decided to stay for eight weeks. Before I went to India, I had to get all the important papers. I also knew that I would have to pay the organization almost ‚Ç¨2,000. The flight was not included. So I decided to work in a supermarket to earn the money. When I got the contract for the project in India, I booked my flight and I was ready to go. When I arrived in Jaipur, I was very tired from the journey and the time difference. The heat, the noise and the smells made it even worse. But I still remember a cow lying in front of the phone shop. During the orientation days I met other volunteers from different countries, which was great. After that I met my host family. They were very friendly people. However, I was homesick during the first days, and I had some problems with the food. It was so spicy. At the time I thought, ‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt feel better soon, I‚Äôll have to quit.‚Äù But I got over it quickly. My job was great but challenging too. The working conditions were OK. I was teaching 10-year-old girls English and organizing some free-time activities for the younger ones. The staff were very helpful. They all spoke English, which made things a little easier. I quickly found out that things are different in India. Most people‚Äôs attitude in India is ‚ÄúWhatever happens, happens.‚Äù And usually that‚Äôs OK for everyone.

Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy ‚Äì after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world‚Äôs electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren‚Äôt available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is ‚Äòfracking‚Äô, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, ‚ÄúFracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.‚Äù But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada‚Äôs oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt seen the end of this yet,‚Äù says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. ‚ÄúCO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.‚Äù 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven‚Äôt stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary.

The week after his death there were violent protests in cities across the United States. But who was this man whose death shook both a nation and also people around the rest of the world? King was born in the American South, in Atlanta, Georgia, on January 15, 1929. He grew up in a religious family. His father was a Baptist pastor and his mother was a church organist. At that time the people in the American South were segregated 3 . Laws made sure that in the Southern states African-American people did not have the same rights as whites. They had to go to different schools and eat in different restaurants. They weren‚Äôt allowed to work with white people. African Americans had to sit at the back of buses and give up their seats to white people. King never wanted to accept this segregation. When he was little, his best friend was a white boy. King, however, had to go to a school for African Americans, while his friend went to a school for whites. So King lost his friend. Over the years King realized how unfair his family and neighbors were treated. He wanted to fight for the civil rights of African Americans. At the age of 18 King decided to become a minister. He felt that the church could give him the best chance to help people and society. He finished college in 1951. He got married to his girlfriend Coretta Scott in 1953, and together they had four children. A year later he became pastor of a Baptist church in Montgomery, Alabama. Protests against racial segregation began in 1955. African-American Rosa Parks hadn‚Äôt wanted to give up her bus seat to white people in the city of Montgomery. Rosa Parks was arrested. King started a campaign 4 . For 381 days people didn‚Äôt use the city‚Äôs public transportation. The campaign was led by Martin Luther King, Jr. During this time his house was bombed and he was arrested too. In the end racial segregation on all Montgomery public transportation was made illegal 5 . It was the first victory 6 for the Civil Rights Movement and it made King a very famous person. In 1957 King and other civil rights activists founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). They wanted to use non-violent protests to achieve 7 civil rights reform. King was influenced by Mahatma Gandhi and his successful non-violent protest against the British Empire in the 1940s. The SCLC started a campaign against racial segregation in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963. Everything was peaceful until the police used water cannons and police dogs against the protesters, even against children. When this was shown on national TV, many white Americans were shocked. The Birmingham campaign was successful and African Americans now had more access 8 to public places. ‚ÄòWhite Only‚Äô and ‚ÄòBlack Only‚Äô signs were removed from restrooms 9 , for example. Early in the Birmingham campaign, King had been arrested again. In his cell he realized that freedom for African-American people would be a long and hard struggle 10 . Later that year King helped organize the March on Washington on August 28, 1963. Its goal was to protest against the way African Americans were treated in Southern states. The protesters wanted an end to racial segregation in schools and at work. They also wanted to protect workers from police brutality. More than 250,000 people joined the march. At the time it was the largest meeting of protesters in the history of Washington, D.C. During this event King gave his most famous speech ‚Äì ‚ÄòI have a dream‚Äô. It became one of the greatest American speeches. Soon after, civil rights became the most important goal for black and white reformers in the United States. Most of the civil rights became law in 1964 and 1965. King got the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 for his role in the Civil Rights Movement. He was also named ‚ÄòPerson of the Year‚Äô by Time magazine. In March 1968 King went to Memphis, Tennessee. He wanted to support African-American workers there who were on strike 11 against bad working conditions. On April 4, 1968 he was shot. James Earl Ray, a white escaped convict 12 , was arrested and was sentenced 13 to 99 years in prison. Since 1983 the third Monday in January has become a national holiday 14 in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. The house where King was born and his grave in Atlanta are national monuments. Streets in towns and cities all over the United States have been named after him. King was the leader of the Civil Rights Movement for almost 13 years. During that time African Americans made a lot of progress on the way towards equality 15 in America. However, many black Americans still experience racial discrimination today. King is known as one of the greatest non-violent leaders in world history. ___ 1 minister [Ààm…™n…™st…ô] ‚àí Pfarrer, Pfarrerin ; 2 civil rights [Àås…™vl Ààra…™ts] ‚àí B√ºrgerrechte ; 3 segregated [Ààsegr…™ge…™t…™d] ‚àí getrennt (nach Hautfarbe) ; 4 campaign [k”ïÀàpe…™n] ‚àí Kampagne, Aktion ; 5 illegal […™Ààli:gl] ‚àí illegal, gesetzeswidrig ; 6 victory [Ààv…™ktri] ‚àí Sieg ; 7 to achieve […ôÀàt‚à´i:v] ‚àí erreichen ; 8 access [Àà”ïkses] ‚àí Zugang, Zutritt ; 9 restroom [ÀàrestÀår äm] ‚àí Toilette ; 10 struggle [Ààstr ågl] ‚àí Kampf ; 11 to be on strike […ín Ààstra…™k] ‚àí streiken ; 12 escaped convict […™Àåske…™pd Ààk…ínv…™kt] ‚àí fl√ºchtiger Str√§fling ; 13 to sentence [Ààsent…ôns] ‚àí verurteilen ; 14 national holiday [Àån”ï‚à´nl Ààh…íl…ôde…™] ‚àí (nationaler) Feiertag ; 15 equality […™Ààkw…íl…ôti] ‚àí Gleichheit ",,7

This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.‚Äù 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven‚Äôt stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won‚Äôt change. ‚ÄúWhat worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúIt will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.‚Äù Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable ‚Äì which means that when we have used them up, there simply won‚Äôt be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada‚Äôs energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better ‚Äì and we will have to.   The sound of ice I‚Äôm standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn‚Äôt have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship‚Äôs doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the ‚Äònorthwest passage‚Äô, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn‚Äôt mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship‚Äôs monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It‚Äôs a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn‚Äôt change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we‚Äôd only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn‚Äôt last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn‚Äôt make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back‚Äôs Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can‚Äôt be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let‚Äôs hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I‚Äôm taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown. Stephen Samuel Stanley ‚Äì ship‚Äôs doctor, HMS Erebus   In New Zealand   Working in India Get to know India and work as a volunteer Teaching young children in an orphanage in Jaipur Building and repairing schools in Goa Helping stray dogs in Ranchi For more information contact Mrs Lal. (a.lal@vii.com) My name is Emma De Santis. I‚Äôm from Germany and I‚Äôm 18 years old. I took part in a project at an orphanage in Jaipur last year. My English isn‚Äôt bad and I used to work as a babysitter for our neighbours‚Äô kids. I could choose to work from four weeks to ten months. I decided to stay for eight weeks. Before I went to India, I had to get all the important papers. I also knew that I would have to pay the organization almost ‚Ç¨2,000. The flight was not included. So I decided to work in a supermarket to earn the money. When I got the contract for the project in India, I booked my flight and I was ready to go. When I arrived in Jaipur, I was very tired from the journey and the time difference. The heat, the noise and the smells made it even worse. But I still remember a cow lying in front of the phone shop. During the orientation days I met other volunteers from different countries, which was great. After that I met my host family. They were very friendly people. However, I was homesick during the first days, and I had some problems with the food. It was so spicy. At the time I thought, ‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt feel better soon, I‚Äôll have to quit.‚Äù But I got over it quickly. My job was great but challenging too. The working conditions were OK. I was teaching 10-year-old girls English and organizing some free-time activities for the younger ones. The staff were very helpful. They all spoke English, which made things a little easier. I quickly found out that things are different in India. Most people‚Äôs attitude in India is ‚ÄúWhatever happens, happens.‚Äù And usually that‚Äôs OK for everyone. Wherever I went, people were smiling at me. But they didn‚Äôt just show interest in me, many of them actually stared at me. But you learn to ignore it. I can really recommend taking part in a project like this. I met wonderful people, made new friends and learned a lot about myself. If you go to India, you‚Äôll never forget it.   ‚ÄòI have a dream‚Äô - Martin Luther King, Jr. On April 4, 1968 the African-American minister 1 and US civil rights 2 leader Martin Luther King, Junior was shot in Memphis, Tennessee. The week after his death there were violent protests in cities across the United States. But who was this man whose death shook both a nation and also people around the rest of the world? King was born in the American South, in Atlanta, Georgia, on January 15, 1929. He grew up in a religious family. His father was a Baptist pastor and his mother was a church organist. At that time the people in the American South were segregated 3 . Laws made sure that in the Southern states African-American people did not have the same rights as whites. They had to go to different schools and eat in different restaurants. They weren‚Äôt allowed to work with white people. African Americans had to sit at the back of buses and give up their seats to white people. King never wanted to accept this segregation. When he was little, his best friend was a white boy. King, however, had to go to a school for African Americans, while his friend went to a school for whites. So King lost his friend. Over the years King realized how unfair his family and neighbors were treated. He wanted to fight for the civil rights of African Americans. At the age of 18 King decided to become a minister. He felt that the church could give him the best chance to help people and society. He finished college in 1951. He got married to his girlfriend Coretta Scott in 1953, and together they had four children. A year later he became pastor of a Baptist church in Montgomery, Alabama. Protests against racial segregation began in 1955. African-American Rosa Parks hadn‚Äôt wanted to give up her bus seat to white people in the city of Montgomery. Rosa Parks was arrested. King started a campaign 4 . For 381 days people didn‚Äôt use the city‚Äôs public transportation. The campaign was led by Martin Luther King, Jr. During this time his house was bombed and he was arrested too. In the end racial segregation on all Montgomery public transportation was made illegal 5 . It was the first victory 6 for the Civil Rights Movement and it made King a very famous person. In 1957 King and other civil rights activists founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). They wanted to use non-violent protests to achieve 7 civil rights reform. King was influenced by Mahatma Gandhi and his successful non-violent protest against the British Empire in the 1940s. The SCLC started a campaign against racial segregation in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963. Everything was peaceful until the police used water cannons and police dogs against the protesters, even against children. When this was shown on national TV, many white Americans were shocked. The Birmingham campaign was successful and African Americans now had more access 8 to public places. ‚ÄòWhite Only‚Äô and ‚ÄòBlack Only‚Äô signs were removed from restrooms 9 , for example. Early in the Birmingham campaign, King had been arrested again. In his cell he realized that freedom for African-American people would be a long and hard struggle 10 . Later that year King helped organize the March on Washington on August 28, 1963. Its goal was to protest against the way African Americans were treated in Southern states. The protesters wanted an end to racial segregation in schools and at work. They also wanted to protect workers from police brutality. More than 250,000 people joined the march. At the time it was the largest meeting of protesters in the history of Washington, D.C. During this event King gave his most famous speech ‚Äì ‚ÄòI have a dream‚Äô. It became one of the greatest American speeches. Soon after, civil rights became the most important goal for black and white reformers in the United States. Most of the civil rights became law in 1964 and 1965. King got the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 for his role in the Civil Rights Movement. He was also named ‚ÄòPerson of the Year‚Äô by Time magazine. In March 1968 King went to Memphis, Tennessee. He wanted to support African-American workers there who were on strike 11 against bad working conditions. On April 4, 1968 he was shot. James Earl Ray, a white escaped convict 12 , was arrested and was sentenced 13 to 99 years in prison. Since 1983 the third Monday in January has become a national holiday 14 in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. The house where King was born and his grave in Atlanta are national monuments. Streets in towns and cities all over the United States have been named after him. King was the leader of the Civil Rights Movement for almost 13 years. During that time African Americans made a lot of progress on the way towards equality 15 in America. However, many black Americans still experience racial discrimination today. King is known as one of the greatest non-violent leaders in world history. ___ 1 minister [Ààm…™n…™st…ô] ‚àí Pfarrer, Pfarrerin ; 2 civil rights [Àås…™vl Ààra…™ts] ‚àí B√ºrgerrechte ; 3 segregated [Ààsegr…™ge…™t…™d] ‚àí getrennt (nach Hautfarbe) ; 4 campaign [k”ïÀàpe…™n] ‚àí Kampagne, Aktion ; 5 illegal […™Ààli:gl] ‚àí illegal, gesetzeswidrig ; 6 victory [Ààv…™ktri] ‚àí Sieg ; 7 to achieve […ôÀàt‚à´i:v] ‚àí erreichen ; 8 access [Àà”ïkses] ‚àí Zugang, Zutritt ; 9 restroom [ÀàrestÀår äm] ‚àí Toilette ; 10 struggle [Ààstr ågl] ‚àí Kampf ; 11 to be on strike […ín Ààstra…™k] ‚àí streiken ; 12 escaped convict […™Àåske…™pd Ààk…ínv…™kt] ‚àí fl√ºchtiger Str√§fling ; 13 to sentence [Ààsent…ôns] ‚àí verurteilen ; 14 national holiday [Àån”ï‚à´nl Ààh…íl…ôde…™] ‚àí (nationaler) Feiertag ; 15 equality […™Ààkw…íl…ôti] ‚àí Gleichheit   What should I do?

We‚Äôve been together since last April. I still go to school in Christchurch, but Danny left school two months ago. I thought he was only looking for a job in Christchurch. Then last week, while we were walking to the cinema, he told me that he got a job as an apprentice chef at a hotel in Wellington. He told me after he had already accepted the job. I was so upset! Danny said that there were no jobs here and he really needed one. We could video chat every day and he would come back to Christchurch whenever he could. But it takes a whole day to get to Wellington by train and ferry. That‚Äôs too far! I really love Danny and I don‚Äôt want to lose him. We belong together! I‚Äôm thinking about leaving school and living with him in Wellington. Of course, my parents don‚Äôt understand. We had a big argument and haven‚Äôt really made up since. They just told me to concentrate on school. Please help me. I really need some advice. Clara RE: He didn‚Äôt tell me. Linda ( online ) 16th June 2021, 8:55 Hello Clara, I understand how you feel. Danny means everything to you. You want to spend every minute with him. Now Danny made an important decision without discussing it with you first. That hurts, doesn‚Äôt it? Maybe it‚Äôs time to talk about what each of you really wants. Ask yourself: What do you want? What are you worried about? Is it really only because Wellington is so far away, or don‚Äôt you trust your boyfriend? Are you afraid that he will cheat on you? How would you feel about breaking up? Whatever you do, don‚Äôt make decisions now that you may not be happy about later. If you want to stay together, you could stay with Danny during the school holidays for a start. That might be OK for your parents. You could still move in with him later, after you‚Äôve finished school. Good luck! Linda ",,4

1. My name is Jonas Fox and I‚Äôm twelve years old. I work in the mines and my job is to sit near a door in the tunnel every day. I must open the door when the coal arrives. Then, after it‚Äôs gone, I quickly close the door again. Every day I sit in the dark, but I‚Äôm never scared. That‚Äôs because my friend Billy is always there with me. Billy sings all day long. He‚Äôs yellow with little black eyes which look like they are made of glass. Billy is a canary, you see? It‚Äôs never boring with Billy around. I would love to sing too, but I can‚Äôt even talk. 
2. Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine killed 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there‚Äôs gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 
3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine. One day Bart started to cough and he never stopped coughing after that. Then one night my brother coughed so badly that he died. That was when I stopped talking. I don‚Äôt know why, really. I still had words in my head and I opened my mouth, but I couldn‚Äôt speak. The men in the mine started to call me ‚ÄòSilent Jonas‚Äô after that. They probably thought I was a bit strange. 
4. The day when things got really bad started like any other. Billy was singing like he always did. I heard the people in the tunnels and the noise of the coal trucks. I opened the door and I felt a cold wind in the tunnel. I closed the door again. Billy stopped singing. For a moment I didn‚Äôt understand. But then, suddenly, I did: There was gas in the mine! And it could explode any second. I didn‚Äôt have time to run down the tunnel to warn the men. If only I could talk, if only I could shout! 
5. I knew I had to warn everyone in the mine. So I opened my mouth and tried to say it: ‚ÄúGas.‚Äù But there was no sound. Nothing came out. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth again. Nothing. I panicked. We could die in here ‚Äì I had to speak! I tried again. This time the sound was quiet, but I made a sound. At last! I opened the door and shouted, ‚ÄúGas. Gas. GAS!‚Äù A moment later I heard the sound of the miners‚Äô boots in the tunnels. I took Billy‚Äôs cage and ran too. 
6. I ran through the tunnel as fast as I could. But my head hurt and I couldn‚Äôt breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn‚Äôt tell where it was coming from. ‚ÄúCome on, boy!‚Äù it said. Somebody picked me up. I turned around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy‚Äôs cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn‚Äôt just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 
7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, ‚ÄúWho warned us?‚Äù ‚ÄúMe!‚Äù I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. ‚ÄúSilent Jonas found his voice!‚Äù a miner shouted. But how could I feel happy? My friend Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small ‚ÄòTweet‚Äô. Billy was alive! I opened the cage ‚Ä¶ 

There were canaries in mines until 1987. Today miners use machines to find out if there is gas in the mine.""",,39

Unlike Newton's theory, which described gravity as a force between masses, Einstein's theory posits that gravity is the result of the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. This theory introduced the concept that massive objects like the Earth and the Sun warp the fabric of spacetime, and this curvature guides the motion of objects, resulting in what we perceive as gravitational attraction. General relativity has been confirmed through various experiments and observations, such as the bending of light by gravity (gravitational lensing) and the precise orbit of Mercury. It has also led to predictions of phenomena such as black holes and gravitational waves, both of which have been observed, further validating the theory. This paradigm shift has had profound implications for our understanding of the universe, from the behavior of planets to the expansion of the cosmos.",,10

Encourage Coughing: Initially, encourage the person to cough forcefully to try to dislodge the object blocking their airway.

Perform Abdominal Thrusts (Heimlich Maneuver):

1. Stand behind the person and wrap your arms around their waist.
2. Make a fist with one hand and place it slightly above the person's navel, thumb side in.
3. Grasp your fist with your other hand and give quick, upward thrusts into the abdomen (inward and upward).
4. Repeat thrusts until the object is expelled or the person becomes unconscious.

Call for Help: If the person cannot breathe, yell for someone to call emergency services (911 or local emergency number) immediately.

Continue Assisting: If the person becomes unconscious, carefully lower them to the ground and start CPR (if trained) while waiting for emergency responders.

A visit to the Eiffel Tower is a must, where you can take the elevator to the top for a breathtaking view of the city. Art lovers should not miss the Louvre Museum, home to thousands of works including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo. Another architectural marvel is the Notre-Dame Cathedral, a masterpiece of Gothic architecture, though its interior is currently under renovation.

For a panoramic view of the Champs-√âlys√©es and the city, climb to the top of the Arc de Triomphe. The Mus√©e d'Orsay, housed in a former railway station, features an extensive collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist masterpieces. Meanwhile, the Centre Pompidou stands out with its modern art collection and eye-catching architecture, offering a great view from its rooftop. The Mus√©e Rodin, dedicated to the works of sculptor Auguste Rodin, is set in a beautiful mansion and garden.

Exploring Montmartre, with its artistic history and the Sacr√©-C≈ìur Basilica, provides a glimpse into the bohemian past of Paris. The Latin Quarter, known for its lively atmosphere, bookstores, and cafes, is another vibrant district worth visiting. Don't miss a tour of the opulent Opera Garnier or even better, catch a performance if you can.

When it comes to parks and gardens, the Luxembourg Gardens offer a serene escape in the heart of the city, while the historic Tuileries Garden, located between the Louvre and Place de la Concorde, is perfect for a leisurely stroll. For a larger green space, head to the Bois de Boulogne, which features lakes, gardens, and even a small amusement park.

Shopping enthusiasts will find plenty to enjoy along the Champs-√âlys√©es, one of the most famous avenues in the world, lined with high-end boutiques and cafes. The trendy district of Le Marais is known for its unique boutiques and vintage shops. For an iconic shopping experience, visit Galeries Lafayette, an impressive department store with a stunning glass dome and rooftop terrace.

Food and drink are integral to the Parisian experience. Enjoy coffee and pastries at iconic cafes like Caf√© de Flore or Les Deux Magots. Sample fresh baguettes, croissants, and other pastries from local bakeries. To immerse yourself in French wine culture, visit the cozy wine bars scattered throughout the city.

For a unique perspective of Paris, take a Seine River cruise. If you‚Äôre feeling adventurous, explore the Catacombs of Paris, an underground ossuary holding the remains of millions of Parisians. Additionally, a day trip to the opulent Palace of Versailles and its expansive gardens is highly recommended.",,8

In both scenarios, regardless of which guard you ask, their answer will point you towards the door that leads to certain death. Therefore, to find the correct door to paradise, you should choose the opposite door to the one they indicate in response to your question.

952,3923,3O9f3XwKld58RGjN7AgETN,EN,identifi describ least one potenti remedi john may receiv case tree health committe thc,"The City Government Spaces Authority (CGSA) responsible for urban parks, initiated a project to enhance safety in Central Park by assessing and maintaining old trees. Over three weeks in April, CGSA, in collaboration with the Tree Health Committee (THC), conducted thorough inspections and decided to implement THC's recommendations to either remove or prune any trees that showed signs of disease or structural weakness. THC directly supervised the inspections carried out by the contracted company, Tree Safe Solutions (TSS).
On 15 July, after a period of heavy rainfall, an old oak tree in Central Park, which had been inspected and cleared by THC and TSS, unexpectedly fell onto a picnic area. The falling tree resulted in serious injuries to several people, including John, who suffered a broken leg and other injuries. Post-incident investigations revealed that the tree had significant internal rot, which had not been detected during the inspection.
The accident attracted widespread media attention, raising public concerns about the safety of other trees in the park. John, alarmed by the incident, contacted CGSA for information about the safety measures in place. CGSA, relying on THC's supervision and TSS's inspection reports, assured John that the trees in the park were safe and posed no further risks. Trusting this assurance, John continued his regular activities in the park.
On 20 September, another tree that had been inspected and deemed safe by THC and TSS, fell near John while he was jogging, causing him to trip and reinjure his leg. This incident necessitated additional medical treatment and significantly impacted John's daily life and work.
Meanwhile, Sarah, who runs a small caf√© near the park, noticed a significant drop in business after the first tree incident. Concerned about the ongoing safety of the park, she reached out to CGSA for reassurance, explaining that her business depended on park visitors. CGSA, based on the reports from THC and TSS, assured Sarah that the park was safe and that no further incidents were expected. Relying on this assurance, Sarah decided to invest in expanding her outdoor seating area to attract more customers. However, after the second tree incident, park attendance dropped even further, causing Sarah significant financial loss due to her recent investment.
John and Sarah now seek legal advice on whether they can pursue a negligence claim against any party regarding their injuries and losses, focusing on the negligent misstatement by CGSA about the safety of the trees. Assess whether the elements of negligence, specifically negligent misstatement, are present and discuss any potential defenses. Also, briefly consider the remedies they might be entitled to if their claims are successful.
Support your advice with references to relevant case law and legislation. You do not need to reference any information outside the provided details and your general knowledge. Where facts are ambiguous, make reasonable inferences. Mention any ambiguities and the inferences you draw to ensure comprehensive advice. Avoid discussing other areas of law, such as consumer protection or criminal law, and limit your analysis to the applicable Civil Wrongs Act. Assume no statutory duties are involved in this scenario. Focus on potential liabilities of identified parties, and do not consider the quantum of damages but rather the appropriate heads of damages (e.g., loss of income). Do not address the apportionment of liability among multiple wrongdoers, if applicable.

La Movida madrile√±a
Durante la d√©cada de 1980 Madrid se convirti√≥ en un importante foco de la contracultura que
se denomin√≥ ""La Movida madrile√±a"". Este movimiento se produjo tras el fin de la censura
franquista y desafi√≥ las normas sociales establecidas mediante la experimentaci√≥n art√≠stica.
Supuso una aut√©ntica explosi√≥n de creatividad multidisciplinar que gener√≥ nuevos √°mbitos de
expresi√≥n tanto en la m√∫sica, con Radio Futura, Nacha Pop y Alaska y Los Pegamoides, que
actuaban en salas como Rock-Ola y La V√≠a L√°ctea; Tambi√©n en el cine, con Pedro Almod√≥var,
Fernando Trueba y Fernando Colomo; con programas de radio y de televisi√≥n; y en la prensa,
con fanzines como Kaka de Luxe yrevistas como La Luna o Madrid Me Mata.

Durante este per√≠odo la literatura ha sabido reflejar la diversidad de voces que, en ocasiones,
reflexionaron sobre la historia yla memoria reciente de Espa√±a. Entre otros muchos, algunos de los
autores m√°s relevantes son Almudena Grandes, Juan Mars√©, Javier Mar√≠as, Juan Goytisolo, Ana
Mar√≠a Matute, Carmen Mart√≠n Gaite, Rosa Montero y Antonio Mu√±oz Molina.
Durante las √∫ltimas d√©cadas el cine espa√±ol ha ganado reconocimiento a nivel internacional con
figuras como el director Pedro Almod√≥var, que supo reflejar la realidad del momento, en oposici√≥n a
la vida convencional anterior a la Espa√±a democr√°tica. El cine ylas series han sido medios poderosos
para promover el debate sobre aspectos sociales y pol√≠ticos y para crear conciencia ciudadana,
como, por ejemplo, con la pel√≠cula Mar adentro, de Alejandro Amen√°bar, sobre el derecho a la
eutanasia.
En cuanto a la m√∫sica, el inicio de la democracia presenci√≥ un auge de la m√∫sica pop yrock en
Espa√±a, con grupos como Mecano y H√©roes del Silencio, al mismo tiempo que se revitalizaban
g√©neros tradicionales como el flamenco, con Paco de Luc√≠a, o la m√∫sica tradicional regional.

M√∫sicos de todas las procedencias
Ya desde la √©poca previa al establecimiento de la democracia en Espa√±a se produjo el auge
de los m√∫sicos que cantaban en su propia lengua, como Llu√≠s Llach y Mar√≠a del Mar Bonet en
Catalu√±a, Raimon en Valencia o Emilio Cao en Galicia. En Andaluc√≠a, destacaron artistas,
vinculados al flamenco como Camar√≥n de la Isla y Paco de Luc√≠a, y otros menos clasificables
como Kiko Veneno y Martirio; y en el Pa√≠s Vasco grupos de rock como Kortatu.
En la actualidad, esta tendencia se mantiene con artistas de primer nivel, como el tr√≠o
Tanxugueiras, en Galicia, que fusionan las ra√≠ces de la m√∫sica tradicional con nuevos ritmos;
en Catalu√±a, con el inclasificable Albert Pla; en la Comunidad Valenciana, con bandas como
Zoo, con una fusi√≥n de rock, rap yreggae; en el Pa√≠s Vasco grupos como Berri Txarrak, con un
estilo entre el rock y el heavy; y en Asturias con Rodrigo Cuevas, que reivindica la m√∫sica
tradicional del folclore que mezcla con la copla yla est√©tica del cabaret.

En cuanto a las artes pl√°sticas, la llegada de la democracia impuls√≥ la creaci√≥n yreforma de museos
y galer√≠as de arte, como el Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof√≠a, en Madrid, con una relevante
colecci√≥n de arte contempor√°neo. En este contexto hist√≥rico, los artistas exploraron nuevos
enfoques ytendencias. Entre otros muchos, cabr√≠a destacar la obra del escultor Eduardo Chillida, de
la fot√≥grafa Cristina Garc√≠a Rodero, del pintor Miquel Barcel√≥ y de la escultora y artista de
instalaciones Cristina Iglesias Fern√°ndez.

El Peine del viento (1977) es una de las obras m√°s reconocidas del escultor vasco Eduardo
Chillida. Esta obra, situada al final de la playa de Ondarreta, en San Sebasti√°n, es un conjunto
escult√≥rico que fusiona el arte con la naturaleza al integrar estructuras de acero con el mar.

Ferias de arte y nuevos museos
Uno de los principales escaparates en la promoci√≥n de artistas es la Feria de Arte
Contempor√°neo ARCO, que se celebra anualmente en Madrid desde 1982. En las √∫ltimas
d√©cadas tambi√©n se han creado importantes museos como el Museo Guggenheim de Bilbao,

Actividad que presenta un contexto de aprendizaje relacionado con
los verbos y sus composiciones

3.1. El verbo y sus componentes
El verbo es una pieza fundamental de nuestra lengua. Por ejemplo, en la oraci√≥n Los lunes
pase√°bamos por el bosque, ¬øqu√© informaci√≥n aporta la palabra pase√°bamos?
Transmite una acci√≥n: pasear, es decir, ""andar por distracci√≥n o ejercicio"".

Advierte de que la acci√≥n no solo la realiza una persona, sino m√°s de una: (Nosotros o nosotras)
pase√°bamos.
Adem√°s, especifica que es una acci√≥n que se realiza en el pasado.

Para cambiar el sujeto o el tiempo de la acci√≥n, es suficiente con cambiar el verbo. Por
ejemplo:
Paseo todos los lunes (1.a persona del singular, presente).
Pasear√©is el lunes (2.a persona del plural, futuro).

Los verbos son palabras que expresan una acci√≥n (escribir, comer), un estado (estar) o un
proceso (vivir, crecer). Junto con los nombres, adjetivos, adverbios, pronombres, conjunciones,
preposiciones y art√≠culos, son una de las ocho clases de palabras que existen.
Los verbos son palabras variables y sus variaciones se producen cuando se a√±aden afijos
flexivos, en forma de desinencia verbal. Estas pueden ser de modo, tiempo, n√∫mero y persona.

Diferenciar los verbos de acci√≥n de los verbos de estado
Actividad que consiste en diferenciar los verbos de estado ylos verbos de
acci√≥n

A veces, se puede dudar de si un adjetivo, un nombre o un adverbio son o no verbos, porque tienen
una ra√≠z muy parecida. Por ejemplo: acci√≥n, accionar, accionado.
Para identificar los verbos, hay que observar si la palabra presenta desinencias verbales. Por
ejemplo: accionary accionado pueden ser verbos porque contienen las desinencias verbales -ar
(infinitivo) y-ado (participio). Sin embargo, acci√≥n no puede ser un verbo porque no tiene ninguna
desinencia verbal.

3.1.1. Las formas verbales caracter√≠sticas del verbo

Las formas del verbo
El verbo presenta diferentes formas en funci√≥n de la informaci√≥n de sus morfemas (como cantaba,
cant√© o cantado). Existen formas personales y no personales.
La mayor parte de las formas verbales expresan informaci√≥n sobre el n√∫mero, la persona, el tiempo,
el modo y el aspecto mediante las desinencias. Estas formas reciben el nombre de formas
personales.
En el caso de un verbo como tend√≠as, se puede deducir por su desinencia (-√≠as) que la acci√≥n la
realiza una segunda persona del singular.

Los tiempos del verbo
Las formas personales del verbo pueden indicar tres tiempos distintos: presente, pasado yfuturo.

La referencia temporal para definir si se trata de pasado, presente o futuro es el momento en el que
quien habla emite el mensaje. Por lo tanto:
El presente coincide con el tiempo en el que quien habla emite el mensaje.
El pasado indica un tiempo anterior al momento en que quien habla emite el mensaje.
El futuro se refiere a un tiempo posterior al momento en que quien habla emite el mensaje.

Para saber m√°s
Per√≠frasis verbales
Las per√≠frasis verbales son combinaciones de dos (o m√°s) verbos que funcionan en bloque,
como si fueran un √∫nico verbo, y que designan una √∫nica acci√≥n, como ocurre con las formas
compuestas. Las per√≠frasis aportan valores modales: c√≥mo enfoca la acci√≥n quien habla; y
aspectuales: c√≥mo se desarrolla la acci√≥n.
Est√°n compuestas por un verbo auxiliar, que pierde su significado l√©xico y aporta los
accidentes verbales, y por un verbo principal en forma no personal, que aporta el significado
l√©xico a la per√≠frasis. Entre estos dos verbos puede aparecer, adem√°s, alguna palabra que
funcione como nexo (una preposici√≥n o una conjunci√≥n).
Por ejemplo:
Tener que + infinitivo

Tengo que estudiar para el examen de ma√±ana.

Estar + gerundio

Mi madre est√° leyendo una novela polic√≠aca.

3.2. Los tipos de verbo
Los verbos tienen un significado, una funci√≥n y una forma. As√≠, en la oraci√≥n Siempre canto en la
ducha, el verbo cantar posee las siguientes caracter√≠sticas:
Tiene el significado de ""emitir sonidos de manera armoniosa"".
Cumple una funci√≥n en la oraci√≥n que consiste en concordar con el sujeto de la oraci√≥n (yo) e
introducir el complemento (en la ducha).
Presenta una forma regular, ya que se conjuga de manera uniforme, igual que otros verbos
acabados en -ar, como bailar o so√±ar.
3.2.1. Verbos regulares e irregulares
Los verbos se clasifican seg√∫n su terminaci√≥n. Es muyimportante saber c√≥mo termina el infinitivo
de un verbo para conjugarlo de manera correcta despu√©s.
Los infinitivos de los verbos pueden terminar de tres formas diferentes.

Clasifica los verbos seg√∫n su conjugaci√≥n
Actividad que permite aplicar lo que los alumnos han aprendido sobre las
conjugaciones verbales

No todos los verbos de la misma terminaci√≥n se conjugan igual. Por ejemplo: si se comparan los
presentes del verbo cantar, del verbo bailary del verbo estar, la primera persona ser√≠a yo canto, yo
bailo yyo estoy. Este √∫ltimo verbo no se conjuga igual que los otros.
Los verbos que se conjugan siguiendo el modelo se llaman regulares, ylos que sufren
modificaciones se llaman irregulares. Por lo tanto, el verbo estar es irregular.

3.2.2. La funci√≥n verbal

Desde el punto de vista de la funci√≥n, los verbos se pueden clasificar en dos tipos: verbos auxiliares y
predicativos.
Verbos auxiliares
Los verbos auxiliares son verbos que pierden su significado para ayudar a otros, que son los que
aportan el significado l√©xico y que se conjugan de forma no personal. Por ejemplo: hab√≠a cantado.
Son verbos auxiliares:
El verbo haber para formas compuestas. Por ejemplo: He cantado.
El verbo ser para formas pasivas. Por ejemplo: Fue construido.
Los verbos poder, deber e ir: Puedes escribir; Debes estudiar; Voy a cantar.

Los auxiliares son como salvavidas verbales: mantienen en la superficie el significado de
otros verbos.

Verbos predicativos
Los verbos predicativos (tambi√©n llamados plenos) son verbos con significado propio que expresan
acciones, procesos o estados. Constituyen el n√∫cleo sem√°ntico y sint√°ctico del predicado verbal. Son
verbos predicativos todos, excepto ser, estar y parecer. Por ejemplo: correr, estudiar, hablar, pensar,
abrir, dormir, construir, etc.
3.2.3. El significado verbal
Desde el punto de vista del significado, los verbos se pueden clasificar en dos tipos: verbos
predicativos (que tambi√©n se clasifican por su funci√≥n, como ya se ha visto) y copulativos.
Verbos copulativos
Los verbos copulativos tienen poco significado por s√≠ mismos y su funci√≥n consiste en unir el sujeto
con su cualidad (llamada en sintaxis atributo). Son el n√∫cleo sint√°ctico del predicado nominal. Los
verbos copulativos son ser, estar y parecer.

3.3. Estructuras argumentales
Los verbos no siempre van solos en la oraci√≥n. Muchas veces est√°n acompa√±ados de otras palabras,
de complementos que permiten completar su significado. Se llama estructura argumental a la
cantidad de elementos que requiere una unidad l√©xica para completar su sentido.

Como en un edificio, las oraciones ylos verbos necesitan de una estructura que ""sostenga"" su
significado.

A veces, es necesario usar alguno de estos complementos porque, si no, las oraciones no tendr√≠an
sentido. En ese caso, los complementos se llaman argumentos. Por ejemplo:
T√∫ escribes una poes√≠a. (Complemento directo con verbo transitivo)
El cartero entreg√≥ la carta al portero. (Complemento indirecto)
El ni√±o est√° triste. (Atributo con verbo copulativo)
Este recinto fue dise√±ado por mi vecino. (Complemento agente en oraci√≥n pasiva)
Me averg√ºenzo de tu actitud. (Complemento de r√©gimen)
3.3.2. Adjuntos
Otros complementos, sin embargo, no son obligatorios porque sin ellos la oraci√≥n tiene significado
completo. Estos complementos que solo aportan m√°s detalles al significado de la oraci√≥n se
denominan adjuntos. Por ejemplo:
La ni√±a compr√≥ un libro a su amigo. (Complemento indirecto)
El estudiante respondi√≥ las preguntas al instante. (Complemento circunstancial)
Ver√≥nica encontr√≥ cansados a los ni√±os. (Complemento predicativo)

Las fracciones con 10, 100, 1000, etc. en el denominador tambi√©n est√°n presentes en el
sistema m√©trico. Por ejemplo, un dec√≠metro es de metro.

Este tipo de fracciones se llaman fracciones decimales.

976,4423,5zJW3y1anz4adDx0pKl81b,EN,discuss result risk analysi,"Assessment task (a workplace situation) description:
Assume you work for a bank, in the risk management department. You work as part of a team, with
your team being responsible, among other things, to perform a Risk Analysis of a new portfolio. Your
colleague, Vitali, has been working on this, but is unable to finish the work due to illness. However,
Vitali sends you the Risk_Analysis.xlsx MS Excel file (to be downloaded from Blackboard) he has been
working on, which shows some of the calculations.
Your task is to continue working on this Excel file that your colleague sent. You need to check the file
carefully because it might have errors in the calculations that you will have to correct. You are now in
charge to finish the calculations and perform the Risk Analysis. Also, you will have to draft an email to
Vitali to explain the errors you identified in his Excel file. Furthermore, you will have to write a report
about the Risk Analysis results and also to prepare a presentation to the bank‚Äôs Chief Risk Officer about
the Risk Analysis results (see below).
Task: Taking the MS Excel file provided as your input, correct any mistakes you find in the file and
perform the Risk Analysis in the Excel file. Please make sure you present the calculations in the file
clearly, and that all calculations are accompanied by a clear description. Also, your task is to draft
an email to Vitali to explain the errors you identified in his Excel file. Furthermore, you are asked to
write a report about the Risk Analysis results to your boss, and also to prepare a PPT presentation
to the bank‚Äôs Chief Risk Office about the Risk Analysis results, as explained below.

The Risk Analysis you are asked to produce for the bank consists of measuring the market risk of a
foreign equity portfolio; specifically, the requirement is to:
(A) Compute the 1% VaR and ES of the FX investment given in the Excel file. Your output should be
a daily series of the portfolio VaR and ES estimates (in ¬£), from 1 January 2020 onwards, using
the EWMA (with Œª = 0.94) and GARCH (please estimate the parameter values using the 2000-
2019 period) volatility models applied to each individual asset in the portfolio. For simplicity,
assume three different scenarios for the asset correlations within the portfolio:
1) assuming zero correlations;
2) assuming the correlation values you estimate, using the 2000 ‚Äì 2019 data period;
3) assuming stress correlations of 0.95.
ÔÇ∑ In the Excel file present visually the 6 VaR series and the 6 ES series.
ÔÇ∑ Backtest the VaR estimates above, explaining whether the above models pass or fail the
backtest conducted at 5% significance level. Discuss the backtest results individually for
the 4 years, that is for 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023.

(B) Assume the CAPM model for the asset returns in the portfolio, estimating the individual betas
using the 2000 ‚Äì 2019 period. Assume that the index volatilities follow a EWMA (with Œª = 0.94)
and GARCH process (please estimate the parameter values using the 200-2019 period). Based
on these, estimate the daily 1% VaR and ES of the investment, starting with 1 January 2020.
Assume the three correlation scenarios given above, for the correlations between the assets.

ÔÇ∑ In the Excel file present visually the 6 VaR series and the 6 ES series (it is 6 in total,
because 3 for EWMA for the 3 different asset correlations, and 3 for GARCH for the 3
different asset correlations).
ÔÇ∑ Backtest the VaR estimates above, explaining whether the above models pass or fail the
backtest conducted at 5% significance level. Discuss the backtest results individually for
the 4 years, that is for 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023.

(C) Suggest an alternative (improved) way to compute the portfolio‚Äôs 1% VaR and ES and
implement your proposed model in the Excel file.
(D) Critically evaluate and discuss the shortcomings of all the above models.",,4
