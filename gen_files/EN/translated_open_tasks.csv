So I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip. I give Pirrip as my father's family name, on the authority of his tombstone and my sister — Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith. As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness of either of them (for their days were long before the days of photographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like were unreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on my father's gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man with curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription, ""also Georgiana wife of the above,"" I drew a childish conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly. To five little stone lozenges, each about a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside their grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of mine—who gave up trying to get a living exceedingly early in that universal struggle — I am indebted for a belief I religiously entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands in their trowsers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state of existence.

Find more information about the product here: digione.ch Why I love Edinburgh I first visited Edinburgh as a child with my parents and my sister. I thought it was a magical city with a very special atmosphere. It’s small enough to get around easily and not feel lost, but big enough that there’s a lot to do. So after I left school, I decided to go to university there. It was a good decision – I had a wonderful time! The locals were really friendly and after some time I even started to understand the Edinburgh accent. In fact, I loved Edinburgh so much that I stayed after university. At first I lived and worked in the city, but after I met my husband (who is a true Scotsman!) we moved to the countryside nearby. I work from home now as I have my own business. But I love to drive to the city at the weekend in my Mini. Last week my parents came to stay and we visited Edinburgh Castle and the Scottish National Gallery. One day we took the children to the zoo, and another day we took a boat out to Inchcolm Abbey on a nearby island. Most days we had a picnic lunch in the Princes Street Gardens.I love that there are so many different things to do in Edinburgh. This city really has become my home now. I couldn’t imagine moving away! Answer the question in a full sentence: Why did Caroline move to Edinburgh? (""She moved to Edinburgh to study and because she loved the city.”)",,271

Only if we’re racists."" Looking back, I regret taking the test. Not because it confirmed the ancestry I could have guessed, nor even for the serious privacy concerns raised by giving my genetic code to a company. What I regret is the ease with which I accepted the racist implications underlying the test: a desire to understand who I am through DNA. In using DNA ancestry tests, we reduce the culture and lived experience that have long defined ethnicity to a biological, racial signifier that is neither especially relevant nor particularly accurate. By joining in, I inadvertently bought into the dangerous notion that who we are lies fundamentally in our blood. There’s no putting the genie of DNA testing back in the bottle. But instead of allowing it to cement racialized ways of thinking, we can use these tests to highlight how meaningless genetic ancestry is compared with the many other factors that shape our experience of ourselves and our communities. That’s exactly what happened in 2018, when Sen. Elizabeth Warren released a DNA test that indicated distant Native American ancestry. In many ways Warren was just using the same flawed, racist logic that I and all other DNA testers followed. Native American leaders rightly pushed back at the time, but the rest of us should, too, when people put undue weight on the findings of these kits.

A common legacy claim to be more comprehensive definition of belonging to belonging to a cultural heritage no reliable source for my identity The cultural heritage for Most of Human History, The Concept of Peoplehood - Of Belong to a Group Larger Than One's Extended Family - HAS - HAS - HASBeen largely determined by shared cultural practices (search as religion, customs and language) or political institutions. Even when groups have claimed common descent from mythological figures, as Han Chinese do, “blood relations” have remained a smaller and unverifiable component of peoplehood. This more capacious notion of belonging is how heritage is lived day to day for most people. I didn’t need a DNA test to identify as a Jew of European ancestry. I already knew that from my family and my culture: from my religion (Judaism), the language of my grandparents (Yiddish), the food I grew up with (noodle kugel, an almost sickly sweet casserole) and the stories of my great-grandparents, fleeing pogroms and learning of the murder of their siblings in the Holocaust. And yet, no matter how strong it was, this sense of cultural heritage didn’t feel like enough for me. In a society that determines so much based on blood ‒ money, connections, assumptions about character ‒ culture by itself felt like an unreliable narrator of my identity. And I wasn’t alone: More than 26 million people are estimated to have taken genealogical DNA tests. Why? The answer goes back to the 18th and 19th centuries, when European colonialism and the slave trade birthed the modern concept of race. As societies were built and genocides committed on the basis of racial hierarchy, it became imperative for racists to prove the biological existence of race. And so race “science” emerged, seeking to dislodge cultural heritage as the prime difference between groups of people. “Aryan” became synonymous with “German,” excluding the many Jewish and Slavic speakers of the language. Graduates of southern Africa’s missionary academies faced a colonial society that saw them as black first, Christian second. While the days of measuring foreheads and skulls are (largely) behind us, race science got a new lease on life when, in the 1950s, scientists discovered the molecular structure of DNA. By the 1980s DNA testing could reliably prove paternity, and by the late 1990s, the first direct-to-consumer genealogical DNA tests were brought to market.

Online Magazine about how young Germans feel by posting a comment in the online paper’s comment section. Use the information provided in the article Deutschlands Jugend - politisch wie nie to explain how young German voters are changing the political landscape. Germany's youth - political than ever? On the evening of the 26th May everyone could guess what it means for a short moment when almost 20 million people raise their voice. The evening of the European elections showed that young people are interested in the world around them - and they are loud. The turnout rose, old parties had to observe with horror how their approval values ​​fell, the Bündnis 90/The Greens triumphed: all a merit of the young voters. No other party in Germany does as well with the 30-year-olds as the Greens. A new, politicized generation is already being spoken in Germany. Comparable only with the young savages of the 1968s, which in Germany questioned values ​​of the post -war period. Similar to over 50 years ago, this generation of climate could also mix up the traditional political operations, create new values, and set its own agenda. […] This only shows what has been home to it for a long time. The “Shell Youth Study” already stated in 2015 that, compared to 2002, 41 percent of young people have already declared that they were politically interested. […] The young people have a powerful ally: the social networks. […] For the political scientist and founder of “Y-Politics” podcast Tanja Hille, the influence of social media stars, who normally do not create political content, is crucial. ""In my generation it was still the case that we had to actively procure information,"" says the 27-year-old. […] In politics, the strengthening of the young voices has not yet reached. Only a few members of younger years can be found in the parties in the Bundestag. And large parties are still awkward when dealing with new forces such as influencers. […] The young CDU politician Diana Kinnert says […]: The concept “Party is unattractive at a hundred different levels. Young people have not become more apolitical;They are just involved. ”YouTuber Diana about the lion also criticizes the defense against the parties. “I think what many are fed up are politicians without passion. We want to see passion again, and sometimes politicians who take us into their everyday life on Instagram. ”___ Lisa Hänel, Deutsche Welle website, 2019 Three Quotes about Society the Minute We Become an integrated Whole, We Look Through the Same Eyes and WeSee A Whole Different World Together. ___ Azizah Al-Hibri, American philosopher and legal scholar Peace is not unity in similarity but unity in diversity, in the comparison and conciliation of differences. ___ Mikhail Gorbachev, former Russian president Unlike a drop of water which loses its identity when it joins the ocean, man does not lose his being in the society in which he lives.

He asks you for information about the impact of the Corona crisis on media consumption in Germany during the first months of the pandemic. Write an email to your friend, referring to the information given in the interview and the statistics. Fake news spread like a virus mirror Mr. Professor Schwab, the most absurd false reports on Corona are circulating on the net: constant drinking water helps against an infection. Or: there is no pandemic at all. Are you amazed at how many people take this for bare coin? Schwab no. Anyone who believes in secret frets or in the existence of UFOs, who also trusts a cross-grade guru who claims on his YouTube channel that he can heal Corona by laying on hand or do the whole thing using a brown flower therapy. That is unfortunately the case. Mirror Why do people fall for something like that? Schwab because, among other things, it has a relieving effect. You stopped the air all the time, and then someone comes and says: You can exhale again, it's not that bad. Some people really think that the corona crisis is staged, inflated, panic. The problem is a lot that we read and hear in the media every day, collides with our own perception. The virus is not visible. No people fall dead in front of our door. Take a look out to the window: the earth is flat, isn't it? To come up with the idea that it is round, a non -trivial cognitive performance. Or you have to believe science. That's how it is with Corona. SPIEGEL How clearly should you make it clear to your Facebook friends [it] when they post nonsense? Schwab I wouldn't write ""nonsense"", otherwise they will offend their friends. If you forward something like this, you have good intentions. Perhaps write: You, thank you for your message, I briefly checked it off, unfortunately that is not true. Then the other may even be grateful. What would help us in these times would also be a kind of communicative hygiene. SPIEGEL What do you mean? Schwab fake news spread rapidly, similar to a virus. It is important that we do not forward everything that is offered to us. So: check the sources. This is the digital variant of washing hands. Mirrors not only have a specifically common false reports these days, but also the offers of the classic media. The number of clicks on the news pages are as high as it is rarely before, the ratings of ""Tagesschau"", talk shows and special programs quickly up. Schwab in times of crisis is brought closer together again, as well as communication. You meet again with the mainstream media. There you get what is the next day. Mirror and that, although the internet is full, with sometimes high -quality information about the corona crisis. Schwab Man had believed that social media would replace television. That's not true. In times of crisis, people rely on the classic broadcasters, especially on public law. Spectators ARD and ZDF trust mirrors more than RTL? Schwab I suspect that people return to the what they grew up with, and the public law purely demographically still have a lead. The private individuals come in second place, then only social media. People who come from Turkey consult Turkish television. Everyone is also looking for their home a little. ___ Alexander Kühn, Der Spiegel , 2020    Three quotes about society The minute we become an integrated whole, we look through the same eyes and we see a whole different world together. ___ Azizah Al-Hibri, American philosopher and legal scholar Peace is not unity in similarity but unity in diversity, in the comparison and conciliation of differences. ___ Mikhail Gorbachev, former Russian president Unlike a drop of water which loses its identity when it joins the ocean, man does not lose his being in the society in which he lives.

In an email to your friend, outline Maas’ attitude to the future relationship between the EU and the UK as pointed out in his letter to the citizens of the UK. We want the closest possible partnership dear British, Keep Calm and Carry On - I hear some of you murmur. But it is not easy for us. Yours stays responsible for such a British serenity - Brexit or not. So, in all German directness: that you go hurts. Not only because the European Union loses 66 million citizens and one of its strongest economies. Global Britain, you have always been. The EU was good. Your pragmatism, your tolerance, your humor, even your insistence on some British special paths - all of this will be painful if you leave the European Union in a few days. Of course we didn't always have it easy, especially since the Brexit referendum. Hearty night sessions in Brussels, almost endless parliamentary debates in Westminster, the increasingly desperate Oordeeer calls of your Mister Speaker-Brexit sounded far too long after the punk rock hit of my youth: Should I Stay or Should I go? […] Of course things will change in our relationship. It inevitably becomes more loose, more non -binding than within the EU. But how loose it gets is in our hands. And for Germany I can say: We want the closest possible partnership with Great Britain, even tomorrow. After all, we not only share this continent, but the same European values ​​that have to assert itself against ever greater resistance in this world. And whether with climate protection, human rights, for future technologies or in questions of European security - we continue to play in the same team! […] This day you can hear occasionally that Great Britain must be punished in the upcoming negotiations for leaving the European Union. I thought that was a big mistake. If we wanted to harm those who turn away, then we would not convert the British in the end, nor convince the rest of the Europeans. Politically wise and, in the best British sense, it is fair to lead the negotiations in such a way that they do not harm the European Union. […] What we need are new, including forms of cooperation- especially in foreign and security policy. A few months ago, I therefore proposed a European security council to coordinate the strategic issues of European security. To act faster in crises. And last but not least, to hold together Britain and the European Union beyond Brexit. With France we are working to concretize this idea as soon as possible. Because we lay a foundation for our future relationship. „ You say Goodbye, I say Hello “, singen die Beatles in ihrem Song. We regulated the goodbye well. And should it turn out to be a ""goodbye"" at some point: there is always room for you - at our table in Brussels and in our hearts. So now let's go to the Hello, to our future. Separated, but together. Goodbye, Hello, Great Britain! ___ Gastbeitrag von Heiko Maas (Bundesaußenminister 2018⎯2021), Die Zeit , 2020    Three quotes about society The minute we become an integrated whole, we look through the same eyes and we see a whole different world together. ___ Azizah Al-Hibri, American philosopher and legal scholar Peace is not unity in similarity but unity in diversity, in the comparison and conciliation of differences. ___ Mikhail Gorbachev, former Russian president Unlike a drop of water which loses its identity when it joins the ocean, man does not lose his being in the society in which he lives. Man’s life is independent. He is born not for the development of the society alone, but for the development of his self. ___ B. R. Ambedkar, former Indian Minister of Law and Justice   The House on Mango Street My name In English my name means hope. In Spanish it means too many letters. It means sadness, it means waiting. It is like the number nine. A muddy color. It is the Mexican records my father plays on Sunday mornings when he is shaving, songs like sobbing. It was my great-grandmother’s name and now it is mine. She was a horse woman too, born like me in the Chinese year of the horse – which is supposed 1 to be bad luck if you’re born female – but I think this is a Chinese lie because the Chinese, like the Mexicans, don’t like their women strong. My great-grandmother. I would've liked to have known her, a wild horse of a woman, so wild she wouldn't marry. Until my great-grandfather threw a sack over her head and carried her off. Just like that, as if she were a fancy chandelier 2 . That’s the way he did it. And the story goes she never forgave him. She looked out the window her whole life, the way so many women sit their sadness on an elbow. I wonder if she made the best with what she got or was she sorry because she couldn’t be all the things she wanted to be. Esperanza. I have inherited her name, but I don’t want to inherit her place by the window. At school they say my name funny as if the syllables were made out of tin and hurt the roof of your mouth. But in Spanish my name is made out of a softer something, like silver, not quite as thick as my sister’s name – Magdalena – which is uglier than mine. Magdalena who at least can come home and become Nenny. But I am always Esperanza. I would like to baptize 3 myself under a new name, a name more like the real me, the one nobody sees. Esperanza as Lisandra or Maritza or Zeze the X. Yes. Something like Zeze the X will do. ___ From: Sandra Cisneros, The House on Mango Street , 2009 1 to suppose to believe; 2 chandelier [ˌʃændəˈlɪə] Kronleuchter ; 3 to baptize taufen   Still I Rise You may write me down in history With your bitter, twisted lies, You may trod 1 me in the very dirt But still, like dust, I’ll rise. – Does my sassiness 2 upset you? Why are you beset 3 with gloom? ’Cause I walk like I’ve got oil wells Pumping in my living room. – Just like moons and like suns, With the certainty of tides, Just like hopes springing high, Still I’ll rise. – Did you want to see me broken? Bowed head and lowered eyes? Shoulders falling down like teardrops, Weakened by my soulful cries? – Does my haughtiness 4 offend you? Don’t you take it awful hard ’Cause I laugh like I’ve got gold mines Diggin’ in my own backyard. – You may shoot me with your words, You may cut me with your eyes, You may kill me with your hatefulness, But still, like air, I’ll rise. Does my sexiness upset you? Does it come as a surprise That I dance like I’ve got diamonds At the meeting of my thighs? – Out of the huts of history’s shame I rise Up from a past that’s rooted in pain I rise I’m a black ocean, leaping and wide, – Welling 5 and swelling I bear in the tide. – Leaving behind nights of terror and fear I rise Into a daybreak that’s wondrously clear I rise Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave, I am the dream and the hope of the slave. I rise I rise I rise. ___ Maya Angelou, 1978 1 trod (past participle of to tread) to crush, to step on; 2 sassiness lively, bold behaviour; 3 to be beset with/by to be decorated/covered/studded with (e.g. jewels); 4 haughtiness [ˈhɔ:tɪnəs] arrogance, pride; 5 to well (up) to flood, to increase, to rise",,1319

Nothing happened today. Just another boring day. When can I go home? Nothing! Aunt Susan wanted me to help with the cows and in the garden, but I stayed in my room and watched films. The village boys tried to pick me up for a football game. I told them that I didn’t have my football shoes and couldn’t play. I can’t believe what happened last night. I woke up in the middle of the night because there was a loud noise in the house. I went to the kitchen and saw Aunt Susan there. She was on the phone, and she was very excited. When she saw me, she told me to come with her. Rosalie needed help. I didn’t know who Rosalie was. I was surprised when I saw that Rosalie was one of Aunt Susan’s cows. She needed help with her calf. Some other people from the village were there too. They were all very calm and knew what to do. They told me to hold the light so that the vet could see well. I could hardly look. That noise! And it smelt terrible. Yuck! 5 Then it was there. A little calf. So sweet, so clumsy. We all felt very happy. I was so tired but so excited. I got up early again. I just had to see if the calf was OK. It was. It stood next to Rosalie and drank its milk. It’s the most beautiful little cow I’ve ever seen 6 . I think I’ll ask Aunt Susan if I can come back again. I think it’s not that bad here. ___ 1 barbecue - grill party;2 hip-hop-hip hop (music direction);3 Bell - the bell;4 ring - ringing;5 Yuck - Igitt 6 The Most Beautiful Cow i’ve ever Seen - The most beautiful cow that I have ever seen",,2003

Luke and Gwen were on the bus. “Dad said we can get a takeaway pizza tonight,” said Gwen. “I love tuna pizza. What’s your favourite pizza, Luke?” Luke didn’t answer. “Did you hear me?” asked Gwen. “Sorry. I’m playing this game on my phone,” said Luke. “I have a really high score. Look!” “I can’t see that,” said Gwen. “Sorry. I forgot you have a problem with your eyes,” said Luke. “You forgot Dave’s birthday. You forgot your homework. You forget everything,” said Gwen. “No, I don’t,” said Luke. He looked out of the window. “Oh no! This is my stop. I forgot where we are! Bye Gwen, see you tomorrow.” Luke rushed down the stairs and got off the bus. He wanted to finish his game. He put his hand in his pocket, but his phone wasn’t there! “Oh no, I must have forgotten it on the bus!” He looked up. But the bus wasn’t there any more. Luke went home and phoned the bus company. They wanted to help but first they needed a special number from his phone – and he didn’t know the number! Luke didn’t enjoy his dinner at all that night. Why wasn’t he more careful with his phone? Suddenly the doorbell rang. “Gwen’s here!” shouted Luke’s mum from the hall. Luke went to the door. Gwen and her dad were there. “I heard something fall on the floor when you got off the bus,” said Gwen. “I asked a woman to see what it was.” Gwen gave Luke his phone. “Wow!” said Luke. “Today is my lucky day! Thanks, Gwen.” “That’s what friends are for!” said Gwen. “Come on, Gwen. Let’s get that pizza!” said Gwen’s dad. Luke put his phone in his pocket. It really was his lucky day. Maybe he could get his best ever high score too. How I won a prize The TV show ‘Teen chef of the year’ tries to find the UK’s best young chef. Twenty-four kids took part in the competition this year.

London is the place for me! Old woman I don’t think so. It’s an awful place. (Dora looks down the road. There is the sound of a bus.) Dora Here’s my bus. Oh … and my name’s Dora White.

I’m Robert, the leader for today’s walk. Can Shruti, Alejandro, Daniel and Maria come with me?” Four students got up and followed Robert. “We’re going to go hiking in the forest,” said Robert. “You should all have long trousers, good shoes, a hat and a bottle of water. Any questions?” “What about lunch?” asked Alejandro. “There’s a packed lunch with sandwiches, fruit and a cake,” answered Robert. “Do I need my GPS 1 map?” asked Maria. “It’s the New Forest, not the Amazon jungle 2 !” said Shruti. “I’ve got a map, but you can take yours too,” said Robert. Maria smiled. 12:34 p.m.: In the forest “When is lunch?” asked Shruti. “We’re going to stop at the picnic spot 3 ,” said Robert. “How far is that?” asked Shruti. “It’s on my map,” said Robert. He looked in his bag as 4 he walked. Suddenly Robert tripped. He fell down a bank and into a small river. His bag opened, and all the sandwiches went into the river. The students ran down to him. “Are you OK?” asked Alejandro. “It’s my ankle,” said Robert. “I think it’s broken.” Maria and Daniel pulled Robert out of the river. Alejandro held his leg as they moved him. Then Shruti took out her phone. “What are we going to do? We don’t know where we are, and there’s no signal!” she said. “I know first aid 5 . I can look after Robert until we get help,” said Alejandro. “And I can use my GPS to find out where we are,” said Maria. Alejandro looked at Robert’s ankle and Daniel gave him some water. Shruti didn’t know what to do. She felt bad. “Come here, Shruti. You can help me,” said Maria. “We need someone to run and get help, and you can run fast.” “Where should I go?” Shruti asked excitedly. “Look at my GPS,” said Maria. “There’s a hill about two miles from here. You can get a signal at the top of it. Run there and call the emergency services.” “Good luck, Shruti!” said Alejandro as Shruti started to run. 2:00 p.m.: In the forest “Where’s Shruti? I hope she’s OK,” said Alejandro. “Robert needs help soon.” Robert was in a lot of pain 6 . Suddenly they heard a noise. “It’s a helicopter!” said Maria. The helicopter landed and soon Shruti arrived with two paramedics. “Well done, Shruti!” said Alejandro. “Thank you. And thank you, Maria, for knowing where to go,” Shruti said. The paramedics gave Robert a warm blanket, a drink and a tablet. “Well done, everyone!” said Robert. “You’ve shown what you can do when you work together. You’ve been an amazing team.” ___ 1 GPS – GPS (satellitengesteuertes weltweites Standortsystem) ; 2 jungle – der Dschungel ; 3 picnic spot – der Picknickplatz ; 4 as – während, als ; 5 first aid – die Erste Hilfe ; 6 pain – der Schmerz",,2510

Gwen and her dad were there. “I heard something fall on the floor when you got off the bus,” said Gwen. “I asked a woman to see what it was.” Gwen gave Luke his phone. “Wow!” said Luke. “Today is my lucky day! Thanks, Gwen.” “That’s what friends are for!” said Gwen. “Come on, Gwen. Let’s get that pizza!” said Gwen’s dad. Luke put his phone in his pocket. It really was his lucky day.

What was it like on the lifeboat? The Titanic disaster The Belfast News Wednesday, 17th April 1912 TWO DAYS AFTER – MORE FACTS The giant ship Titanic, which was built here in Belfast’s shipyard, hit an iceberg on 14th April, shortly before midnight. Water filled the ship until it sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD’S LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship’s builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. LOCAL MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland. The ship’s doctor, Dr John Simpson, 37, was born in Belfast. His mother was optimistic when a letter from him arrived at her home yesterday. However, we have found out that he posted the letter during the ship’s last stop. We now know that Dr Simpson did not survive.

According to a passenger, one of the dogs on board saved the lives of the people in one lifeboat. A ship only found this lifeboat in the dark night and the foggy weather because they heard the dog when it barked. HOW COULD IT HAPPEN? After the sinking of the Titanic a number of questions still need answers. Why did no one see the iceberg? Why did the ship break? Why were there only 20 lifeboats for 2,200 people on board? Why did lifeboats leave the ship when they were not yet full? And how can we make sure that an accident like this will never happen again? About 700 people survived the accident.

Dr Simpson’s last letter to his mother is now in the Belfast Titanic museum. A deadly silence 1. My name is Jonas Fox and I’m twelve years old. I work in the mines and my job is to sit near a door in the tunnel every day. I must open the door when the coal arrives. Then, after it’s gone, I quickly close the door again. Every day I sit in the dark, but I’m never scared. That’s because my friend Billy is always there with me. Billy sings all day long. He’s yellow with little black eyes which look like they are made of glass. Billy is a canary, you see? It’s never boring with Billy around. I would love to sing too, but I can’t even talk. 2. Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine killed 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there’s gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine. One day Bart started to cough and he never stopped coughing after that. Then one night my brother coughed so badly that he died. That was when I stopped talking. I don’t know why, really. I still had words in my head and I opened my mouth, but I couldn’t speak. The men in the mine started to call me ‘Silent Jonas’ after that. They probably thought I was a bit strange. 4. The day when things got really bad started like any other. Billy was singing like he always did. I heard the people in the tunnels and the noise of the coal trucks. I opened the door and I felt a cold wind in the tunnel. I closed the door again. Billy stopped singing. For a moment I didn’t understand. But then, suddenly, I did: There was gas in the mine! And it could explode any second. I didn’t have time to run down the tunnel to warn the men. If only I could talk, if only I could shout! 5. I knew I had to warn everyone in the mine. So I opened my mouth and tried to say it: “Gas.” But there was no sound. Nothing came out. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth again. Nothing. I panicked. We could die in here – I had to speak! I tried again. This time the sound was quiet, but I made a sound. At last! I opened the door and shouted, “Gas. Gas. GAS!” A moment later I heard the sound of the miners’ boots in the tunnels. I took Billy’s cage and ran too. 6. I ran through the tunnel as fast as I could. But my head hurt and I couldn’t breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn’t tell where it was coming from. “Come on, boy!” it said. Somebody picked me up. I turned around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy’s cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn’t just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, “Who warned us?” “Me!” I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. “Silent Jonas found his voice!” a miner shouted. But how could I feel happy? My friend Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small ‘Tweet’. Billy was alive!

He had no children and both his Anglo-Saxon brother-in-law, Harold, and his French cousin, William, Duke of Normandy, wanted to be the next king of England. Harold made himself king, and William was very angry. So what did he do next? He sailed to England with his army … Harold and William fought the battle on Senlac Hill, near Hastings. William’s men were knights and they were better trained. They fought on horses and were good archers. Harold’s men fought on foot and they were already tired from an earlier battle at Stamford Bridge, 200 miles away in the north of England. (Yes, they had to walk those 200 miles!) How do we know what happened during the Battle of Hastings? Well, we have the 70-metre long Bayeux Tapestry to tell us! The tapestry is like a comic and it tells the story of the battle. It tells us that Harold died when he got an arrow in his eye, but we don’t know if this really happened. William won the Battle of Hastings and he became king of England on Christmas Day 1066. Today we know him as William the Conqueror. He was a big castle fan and built lots of them in England, including part of the Tower of London. He also took land from the Anglo-Saxons and gave it to his Norman friends. Did the Normans change England? Yes, of course they did! For example, they brought many new words to the English language. Words like ‘pork’ and ‘garden’ come from this time. Guess what? There are still many English people who have Norman surnames, like Archer or Darcy. Before the Normans came to England, most people didn’t even have surnames.

The RNLI has saved about 140,000 lives since 1824. Many of the lifeboat crew members are volunteers. The RNLI gets money from fundraising. 18th June 2016, by Simon Spade Yesterday the RNLI rescued two teenage boys who got into trouble when they were kayaking off the coast near Llandudno. The two 14-year-old boys went out too far in their kayaks and could not get back to the beach because of strong winds. They tried to get back for more than two and a half hours, then shouted for help and waved. A tourist spotted the boys and made an emergency call to the RNLI. The lifeboat crew left their station at 1:40 p.m. and got to the kayaks in only a few minutes. The RNLI crew picked up the boys and gave them blankets and hot drinks to keep them warm. Lifeboat helm Howard Link called the ambulance to meet them on the beach. Both boys were very weak and seasick. They both spent the night in Llandudno hospital but are back home now. The lifeboat crew got back to their station at 3:25 p.m. There are some rules to remember when you go to the beach: S pot the dangers. A lways go with a friend or adult. Find and follow the safety signs and flags. E mergency – put up your hand and shout or call 999/112. Most lifeboat crew members are volunteers. Let’s meet some.

Water filled the ship until it sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD’S LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship’s builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. LOCAL MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland. The ship’s doctor, Dr John Simpson, 37, was born in Belfast. His mother was optimistic when a letter from him arrived at her home yesterday. However, we have found out that he posted the letter during the ship’s last stop. We now know that Dr Simpson did not survive. DOG SAVES LIVES Some were lucky and the ships which came to save the passengers of the Titanic found their lifeboat.

I work in the mines and my job is to sit near a door in the tunnel every day. I must open the door when the coal arrives. Then, after it’s gone, I quickly close the door again. Every day I sit in the dark, but I’m never scared. That’s because my friend Billy is always there with me. Billy sings all day long. He’s yellow with little black eyes which look like they are made of glass. Billy is a canary, you see? It’s never boring with Billy around. I would love to sing too, but I can’t even talk. 2. Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine killed 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there’s gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine. One day Bart started to cough and he never stopped coughing after that. Then one night my brother coughed so badly that he died. That was when I stopped talking. I don’t know why, really. I still had words in my head and I opened my mouth, but I couldn’t speak. The men in the mine started to call me ‘Silent Jonas’ after that. They probably thought I was a bit strange. 4. The day when things got really bad started like any other. Billy was singing like he always did. I heard the people in the tunnels and the noise of the coal trucks. I opened the door and I felt a cold wind in the tunnel. I closed the door again. Billy stopped singing. For a moment I didn’t understand. But then, suddenly, I did: There was gas in the mine! And it could explode any second. I didn’t have time to run down the tunnel to warn the men. If only I could talk, if only I could shout! 5. I knew I had to warn everyone in the mine. So I opened my mouth and tried to say it: “Gas.” But there was no sound. Nothing came out. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth again. Nothing. I panicked. We could die in here – I had to speak! I tried again. This time the sound was quiet, but I made a sound. At last! I opened the door and shouted, “Gas. Gas. GAS!” A moment later I heard the sound of the miners’ boots in the tunnels. I took Billy’s cage and ran too. 6. I ran through the tunnel as fast as I could. But my head hurt and I couldn’t breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn’t tell where it was coming from. “Come on, boy!” it said. Somebody picked me up. I turned around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy’s cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn’t just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, “Who warned us?” “Me!” I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. “Silent Jonas found his voice!” a miner shouted. But how could I feel happy? My friend Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small ‘Tweet’. Billy was alive! I opened the cage … There were canaries in mines until 1987. Today miners use machines to find out if there is gas in the mine. The Norman conquest The old king of England, Edward, died in 1066. He had no children and both his Anglo-Saxon brother-in-law, Harold, and his French cousin, William, Duke of Normandy, wanted to be the next king of England. Harold made himself king, and William was very angry. So what did he do next? He sailed to England with his army … Harold and William fought the battle on Senlac Hill, near Hastings. William’s men were knights and they were better trained. They fought on horses and were good archers. Harold’s men fought on foot and they were already tired from an earlier battle at Stamford Bridge, 200 miles away in the north of England. (Yes, they had to walk those 200 miles!) How do we know what happened during the Battle of Hastings? Well, we have the 70-metre long Bayeux Tapestry to tell us! The tapestry is like a comic and it tells the story of the battle. It tells us that Harold died when he got an arrow in his eye, but we don’t know if this really happened. William won the Battle of Hastings and he became king of England on Christmas Day 1066. Today we know him as William the Conqueror. He was a big castle fan and built lots of them in England, including part of the Tower of London. He also took land from the Anglo-Saxons and gave it to his Norman friends. Did the Normans change England? Yes, of course they did! For example, they brought many new words to the English language. Words like ‘pork’ and ‘garden’ come from this time. Guess what? There are still many English people who have Norman surnames, like Archer or Darcy. Before the Normans came to England, most people didn’t even have surnames. They lived in small villages, so a first name or a nickname was often enough. ___ Conquest - conquest;The Anglo-Saxons-the Anglo-Saxons (the people who lived in England before 1066);Brother-in-Law-brother-in-law;Duke - Duke;Army - army;Army;Knight - knight;Archer - archer;Archer;Tapestry - wall carpet;Sur name - last name;Family name the rnli: Volunteers on the coast the rnli is the royal national lifeboat institution.

The two 14-year-old boys went out too far in their kayaks and could not get back to the beach because of strong winds. They tried to get back for more than two and a half hours, then shouted for help and waved. A tourist spotted the boys and made an emergency call to the RNLI. The lifeboat crew left their station at 1:40 p.m. and got to the kayaks in only a few minutes. The RNLI crew picked up the boys and gave them blankets and hot drinks to keep them warm.

Water filled the ship until it sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. It was on its way from Southampton to New York, on its very first voyage. There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The people who were not in lifeboats when the ship sank did not survive in the cold sea. About 1,500 people died. WORLD’S LARGEST SHIP The Titanic was the largest and most expensive ship in the world. It had a swimming pool, Turkish baths, a gymnasium and two libraries. The ship’s builders, The White Star Line company, were sure that their ship was safe and could not possibly sink, so the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats. Those were only enough for 1,178 people, which is a bit more than half of the people on board the ship. LOCAL MEN DIE AT SEA Twenty of the crew were from Northern Ireland. The ship’s doctor, Dr John Simpson, 37, was born in Belfast. His mother was optimistic when a letter from him arrived at her home yesterday. However, we have found out that he posted the letter during the ship’s last stop. We now know that Dr Simpson did not survive. DOG SAVES LIVES Some were lucky and the ships which came to save the passengers of the Titanic found their lifeboat. According to a passenger, one of the dogs on board saved the lives of the people in one lifeboat. A ship only found this lifeboat in the dark night and the foggy weather because they heard the dog when it barked. HOW COULD IT HAPPEN? After the sinking of the Titanic a number of questions still need answers. Why did no one see the iceberg? Why did the ship break? Why were there only 20 lifeboats for 2,200 people on board? Why did lifeboats leave the ship when they were not yet full? And how can we make sure that an accident like this will never happen again? About 700 people survived the accident. Some ships today have over 6,500 passengers and crew. After the Titanic’s accident there were laws that ships must have one lifeboat place for every person on board.

I was glad I wasn’t sleeping there that night, and the thought of where we were going made me excited again. I rolled up two blankets and tied an old belt around them. I grabbed all my money, which was less than a dollar. Then I was ready to go. I went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad. I was walking up Carbine Street towards the clubhouse when Chris caught up with me. His eyes were shining. “Gordie! You want to see something?” “Sure. What?” “Come down here first.” He pointed down an alley between two shops. “What is it, Chris?” “Come on, I said!” He ran down the alley and I ran after him. At the bottom, the smell from the trash was terrible. “Chris, I’m going to puke, I’m – ” But I forgot about the smell when Chris put his hand into his backpack and pulled out a big gun. “Where did you get that?” “From my dad’s desk.” “Man, your dad’s going to beat you when he finds out.” Chris’s eyes just went on dancing. “He isn’t going to find out. He and his friends have got enough wine to keep them drunk for a week. I’ll put it back before then.” Chris hated alcohol – he’d already seen too much of what it can do. He was the only one of us who didn’t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they’d stolen from their father. “Have you got bullets for it?” “Nine of them – all that was left in the box. He’ll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.” “Any in it at the moment?” “No, of course not. What do you think I am?” I finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA – BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin – it was the work of an evil magician. “Wow!” I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn’t tell if he was amused or scared. “You did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!” “Shut up! Let’s go!” I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. “Man, it’s a pity you couldn’t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.” “You knew there was a bullet in it, didn’t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.” “I didn’t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad’s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.” Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, “What do you think we need a gun for?” “Nothing, really,” Chris said. “Except we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it’s frightening out in the forest at night.” Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that.

For him, that was real thinking. He grinned. “So let’s go,” Teddy said. “It’s nearly twelve already.” Chris stood up and we gathered round him. “We’ll walk across Beeman’s field,” he said, “and then we’ll get to the railway tracks and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.” “How far is it, do you think?” Teddy asked. “I don’t know,” said Chris. “Harlow’s big.

American football on the sofa? In the last couple of years a new trend has become popular in the USA: More people like to eat better quality food and live a more active life. introduction It is slowly going out of fashion to live off convenience and frozen food. A number of people shop for organic food at special supermarkets instead. In some states farmers’ markets offer a great variety of fresh vegetables and fruit from the region. “There are also dairy products, bread and meat without chemical additives at these markets.

Don’t worry, you don’t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: “Drinking too much alcohol isn’t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?” Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don’t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion",,1235

He and his friends have got enough wine to keep them drunk for a week. I’ll put it back before then.” Chris hated alcohol – he’d already seen too much of what it can do. He was the only one of us who didn’t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they’d stolen from their father. “Have you got bullets for it?” “Nine of them – all that was left in the box.

Don’t worry, you don’t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: “Drinking too much alcohol isn’t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?” Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don’t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion   A first date Dylan often thought about Abby. He really liked her. But he was too shy to ask her out on a date. Dylan’s friend Forget her. She’s not interested in you. She has a boyfriend. One day his books fell out of his locker right when Abby showed up. With Scott in tow, of course. How embarrassing. Scott Who’s that guy? Look at him! A few days later they had lunch together. Dylan helped Abby with her Science project. They didn’t notice Scott and his football friends. Scott’s friend Isn’t she your girlfriend? Dylan Let me explain. It’s not that hard! When Dylan went to the gym, the boys attacked him. Scott pushed him really hard and Dylan couldn’t do anything about it. Scott Stay away from her! Abby Stop it! You’re hurting him!

The Body In “The Body”, Gordie Lachance and his three friends learn that a boy from their area, in the state of Maine, has disappeared and is probably dead. They decide to go on a trip to find the boy’s body and prepare for the trip. The Gun My room was on the second floor, and it was really hot up there. I was glad I wasn’t sleeping there that night, and the thought of where we were going made me excited again. I rolled up two blankets and tied an old belt around them. I grabbed all my money, which was less than a dollar. Then I was ready to go. I went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad. I was walking up Carbine Street towards the clubhouse when Chris caught up with me. His eyes were shining. “Gordie! You want to see something?” “Sure. What?” “Come down here first.” He pointed down an alley between two shops. “What is it, Chris?” “Come on, I said!” He ran down the alley and I ran after him. At the bottom, the smell from the trash was terrible. “Chris, I’m going to puke, I’m – ” But I forgot about the smell when Chris put his hand into his backpack and pulled out a big gun. “Where did you get that?” “From my dad’s desk.” “Man, your dad’s going to beat you when he finds out.” Chris’s eyes just went on dancing. “He isn’t going to find out. He and his friends have got enough wine to keep them drunk for a week. I’ll put it back before then.” Chris hated alcohol – he’d already seen too much of what it can do. He was the only one of us who didn’t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they’d stolen from their father. “Have you got bullets for it?” “Nine of them – all that was left in the box. He’ll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.” “Any in it at the moment?” “No, of course not. What do you think I am?” I finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA – BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin – it was the work of an evil magician. “Wow!” I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn’t tell if he was amused or scared. “You did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!” “Shut up! Let’s go!” I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. “Man, it’s a pity you couldn’t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.” “You knew there was a bullet in it, didn’t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.” “I didn’t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad’s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.” Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, “What do you think we need a gun for?” “Nothing, really,” Chris said. “Except we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it’s frightening out in the forest at night.” Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?” Teddy asked Vern. “Yeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it’ll look as if we’re there after dark.” “Hey, man, great!” I said, and slapped Vern on the back. For him, that was real thinking. He grinned. “So let’s go,” Teddy said. “It’s nearly twelve already.” Chris stood up and we gathered round him. “We’ll walk across Beeman’s field,” he said, “and then we’ll get to the railway tracks and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.” “How far is it, do you think?” Teddy asked. “I don’t know,” said Chris. “Harlow’s big. We’re going to have to walk at least twenty miles. Does that sound right to you, Gordie?” “Yeah. Maybe more – thirty miles.” “Come on, you guys,” Chris said, and picked up his backpack, blankets and water bottle. Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? headline written by Pam Warner (published 07/12/16 in Health & Style ) author, date, source What is your Thanksgiving like? Turkey and pumpkin pie? American football on the sofa? In the last couple of years a new trend has become popular in the USA: More people like to eat better quality food and live a more active life. introduction It is slowly going out of fashion to live off convenience and frozen food. A number of people shop for organic food at special supermarkets instead. In some states farmers’ markets offer a great variety of fresh vegetables and fruit from the region. “There are also dairy products, bread and meat without chemical additives at these markets. Organic food is not only much healthier but it tastes a lot better as well,” explains Emma from Boston. So how about some healthy recipes for Thanksgiving? Maybe pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes? A roast turkey breast or a turkey roulade filled with apples and cranberries is delicious too. But there’s more to a healthy lifestyle than just food.

Many big farms in California employ children, mostly from Latin America, to pick fruit or vegetables. Children have to help their parents earn their living because migrant parents often don’t have enough income. It is difficult for them to get a better job because many of them don’t have many qualifications or can hardly speak English. Some are even in the USA illegally. All laborers have the legal right to take breaks and get water to drink in the state of California. But in reality things are different. Fresno Weekly Magazine talked to Matteo (12) and his brother Ramon (14) from Sacramento, who have been working on different farms. Fresno Weekly What are the working conditions like for you? Matteo We have to get up at 4:30 in the morning. Buses drive us to the fields, where we work all day in the heat. We sometimes work more than ten hours a day and only earn the minimum wage or even less. The long hours in the fields make you tired. Fresno Weekly Ramon, how long have you been working in the fields? Ramon Since I was ten, just like my Dad. Fresno Weekly Do you have any health problems? Ramon Yes, because of the pesticides I always have difficulty breathing and I have a constant headache out there. But that’s not all. Some people get injured working with the large machines. A federal law from 1938 allows farm owners to employ children from the age of twelve on big farms and even younger children on small farms. From the age of 14 teenagers can do farm work without their parents’ consent. Officially, they are only allowed to work outside school hours, but some of them don’t even finish high school. There are no statistics about how many children spend their days as farm helpers, but the estimate is about half a million. All recent attempts to change the law have failed.",,2070

Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy – after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world’s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren’t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is ‘fracking’, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, “Fracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.” But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada’s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. “We haven’t seen the end of this yet,” says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. “CO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.” 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven’t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won’t change. “What worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,” he adds. “It will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.” Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable – which means that when we have used them up, there simply won’t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada’s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better – and we will have to.",,785

We can do even better – and we will have to. The sound of ice I’m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn’t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship’s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the ‘northwest passage’, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn’t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship’s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It’s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn’t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we’d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn’t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ratio of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn’t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back’s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can’t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let’s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I’m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown. Stephen Samuel Stanley – ship’s doctor, HMS Erebus",,2174

There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada’s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. “We haven’t seen the end of this yet,” says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. “CO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.” 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven’t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won’t change. “What worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,” he adds. “It will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.” Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable – which means that when we have used them up, there simply won’t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada’s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better – and we will have to. The sound of ice I’m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn’t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship’s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the ‘northwest passage’, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn’t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship’s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It’s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn’t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we’d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn’t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ratio of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn’t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back’s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can’t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let’s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I’m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown.

Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy – after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world’s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren’t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is ‘fracking’, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, “Fracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.” But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking.

Before I went to India, I had to get all the important papers. I also knew that I would have to pay the organization almost €2,000. The flight was not included. So I decided to work in a supermarket to earn the money. When I got the contract for the project in India, I booked my flight and I was ready to go. When I arrived in Jaipur, I was very tired from the journey and the time difference. The heat, the noise and the smells made it even worse. But I still remember a cow lying in front of the phone shop. During the orientation days I met other volunteers from different countries, which was great. After that I met my host family. They were very friendly people. However, I was homesick during the first days, and I had some problems with the food. It was so spicy. At the time I thought, “If I don’t feel better soon, I’ll have to quit.” But I got over it quickly. My job was great but challenging too. The working conditions were OK. I was teaching 10-year-old girls English and organizing some free-time activities for the younger ones. The staff were very helpful. They all spoke English, which made things a little easier. I quickly found out that things are different in India. Most people’s attitude in India is “Whatever happens, happens.” And usually that’s OK for everyone. Wherever I went, people were smiling at me. But they didn’t just show interest in me, many of them actually stared at me. But you learn to ignore it. I can really recommend taking part in a project like this. I met wonderful people, made new friends and learned a lot about myself. If you go to India, you’ll never forget it.",,2578
3132,6BKtN5ZByiq6CALJjrLthp,EN,"What do you find most interesting about Martin Luther King, Jr.’s life? We can do even better – by Lindsay Fern (21/1/2017) 1. Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy – after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world’s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren’t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is ‘fracking’, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, “Fracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.” But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada’s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. “We haven’t seen the end of this yet,” says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. “CO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.” 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven’t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won’t change. “What worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,” he adds. “It will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.” Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable – which means that when we have used them up, there simply won’t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada’s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better – and we will have to. The sound of ice I’m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn’t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship’s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the ‘northwest passage’, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn’t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship’s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It’s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn’t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we’d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn’t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ratio of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn’t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back’s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can’t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let’s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I’m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown.

If you go to India, you’ll never forget it. ‘I have a dream’ - Martin Luther King, Jr. On April 4, 1968 the African-American minister 1 and US civil rights 2 leader Martin Luther King, Junior was shot in Memphis, Tennessee. The week after his death there were violent protests in cities across the United States. But who was this man whose death shook both a nation and also people around the rest of the world? King was born in the American South, in Atlanta, Georgia, on January 15, 1929. He grew up in a religious family. His father was a Baptist pastor and his mother was a church organist. At that time the people in the American South were segregated 3 . Laws made sure that in the Southern states African-American people did not have the same rights as whites. They had to go to different schools and eat in different restaurants. They weren’t allowed to work with white people. African Americans had to sit at the back of buses and give up their seats to white people. King never wanted to accept this segregation. When he was little, his best friend was a white boy. King, however, had to go to a school for African Americans, while his friend went to a school for whites. So King lost his friend. Over the years King realized how unfair his family and neighbors were treated. He wanted to fight for the civil rights of African Americans. At the age of 18 King decided to become a minister. He felt that the church could give him the best chance to help people and society. He finished college in 1951. He got married to his girlfriend Coretta Scott in 1953, and together they had four children. A year later he became pastor of a Baptist church in Montgomery, Alabama. Protests against racial segregation began in 1955. African-American Rosa Parks hadn’t wanted to give up her bus seat to white people in the city of Montgomery. Rosa Parks was arrested. King started a campaign 4 . For 381 days people didn’t use the city’s public transportation. The campaign was led by Martin Luther King, Jr. During this time his house was bombed and he was arrested too. In the end racial segregation on all Montgomery public transportation was made illegal 5 . It was the first victory 6 for the Civil Rights Movement and it made King a very famous person. In 1957 King and other civil rights activists founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). They wanted to use non-violent protests to achieve 7 civil rights reform. King was influenced by Mahatma Gandhi and his successful non-violent protest against the British Empire in the 1940s. The SCLC started a campaign against racial segregation in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963. Everything was peaceful until the police used water cannons and police dogs against the protesters, even against children. When this was shown on national TV, many white Americans were shocked. The Birmingham campaign was successful and African Americans now had more access 8 to public places. ‘White Only’ and ‘Black Only’ signs were removed from restrooms 9 , for example. Early in the Birmingham campaign, King had been arrested again. In his cell he realized that freedom for African-American people would be a long and hard struggle 10 . Later that year King helped organize the March on Washington on August 28, 1963. Its goal was to protest against the way African Americans were treated in Southern states. The protesters wanted an end to racial segregation in schools and at work. They also wanted to protect workers from police brutality. More than 250,000 people joined the march. At the time it was the largest meeting of protesters in the history of Washington, D.C. During this event King gave his most famous speech – ‘I have a dream’. It became one of the greatest American speeches. Soon after, civil rights became the most important goal for black and white reformers in the United States. Most of the civil rights became law in 1964 and 1965. King got the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 for his role in the Civil Rights Movement. He was also named ‘Person of the Year’ by Time magazine. In March 1968 King went to Memphis, Tennessee. He wanted to support African-American workers there who were on strike 11 against bad working conditions. On April 4, 1968 he was shot. James Earl Ray, a white escaped convict 12 , was arrested and was sentenced 13 to 99 years in prison. Since 1983 the third Monday in January has become a national holiday 14 in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. The house where King was born and his grave in Atlanta are national monuments. Streets in towns and cities all over the United States have been named after him. King was the leader of the Civil Rights Movement for almost 13 years. During that time African Americans made a lot of progress on the way towards equality 15 in America. However, many black Americans still experience racial discrimination today. King is known as one of the greatest non-violent leaders in world history. ___ 1 minister [ˈMɪnɪstə] - pastor, pastor;2 civil rights [ˌsɪvl ˈraɪts] - civil rights;3 segregated [ˈSeggeɪtɪd] - separated (according to skin color);4 Campaign [KӕˈPEɪN] - Campaign, action;5 illegal [ɪˈli: gl] - illegal, illegal;6 Victory [ˈvɪktri] - victory;7 to achieve [ival: v] - reach;8 Access [ˈӕkses] - Access, access;9 Restroom [ˈrestˌrʊm] - toilet;10 struggle [ˈstrʌgl] - fight;11 to be on strike [ɒn ˈstraɪk] - strike;12 escaped convict [ɪˌskeɪpd ˈkɒnvɪkt] - fleeting convict;13 to Sentence [ˈsentəns] - condemn;14 National Holiday [ˌnӕínl ˈhɒlədeɪ] - (national) holiday;15 Equality [ɪˈkwɒləti] - equality",,3535

At the time I thought, “If I don’t feel better soon, I’ll have to quit.” But I got over it quickly. My job was great but challenging too. The working conditions were OK. I was teaching 10-year-old girls English and organizing some free-time activities for the younger ones. The staff were very helpful. They all spoke English, which made things a little easier. I quickly found out that things are different in India. Most people’s attitude in India is “Whatever happens, happens.” And usually that’s OK for everyone. Wherever I went, people were smiling at me. But they didn’t just show interest in me, many of them actually stared at me. But you learn to ignore it. I can really recommend taking part in a project like this. I met wonderful people, made new friends and learned a lot about myself. If you go to India, you’ll never forget it. ‘I have a dream’ - Martin Luther King, Jr. On April 4, 1968 the African-American minister 1 and US civil rights 2 leader Martin Luther King, Junior was shot in Memphis, Tennessee. The week after his death there were violent protests in cities across the United States. But who was this man whose death shook both a nation and also people around the rest of the world? King was born in the American South, in Atlanta, Georgia, on January 15, 1929. He grew up in a religious family. His father was a Baptist pastor and his mother was a church organist. At that time the people in the American South were segregated 3 . Laws made sure that in the Southern states African-American people did not have the same rights as whites. They had to go to different schools and eat in different restaurants. They weren’t allowed to work with white people. African Americans had to sit at the back of buses and give up their seats to white people. King never wanted to accept this segregation. When he was little, his best friend was a white boy. King, however, had to go to a school for African Americans, while his friend went to a school for whites. So King lost his friend. Over the years King realized how unfair his family and neighbors were treated. He wanted to fight for the civil rights of African Americans. At the age of 18 King decided to become a minister. He felt that the church could give him the best chance to help people and society. He finished college in 1951. He got married to his girlfriend Coretta Scott in 1953, and together they had four children. A year later he became pastor of a Baptist church in Montgomery, Alabama. Protests against racial segregation began in 1955. African-American Rosa Parks hadn’t wanted to give up her bus seat to white people in the city of Montgomery. Rosa Parks was arrested. King started a campaign 4 . For 381 days people didn’t use the city’s public transportation. The campaign was led by Martin Luther King, Jr. During this time his house was bombed and he was arrested too. In the end racial segregation on all Montgomery public transportation was made illegal 5 . It was the first victory 6 for the Civil Rights Movement and it made King a very famous person. In 1957 King and other civil rights activists founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). They wanted to use non-violent protests to achieve 7 civil rights reform. King was influenced by Mahatma Gandhi and his successful non-violent protest against the British Empire in the 1940s. The SCLC started a campaign against racial segregation in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963. Everything was peaceful until the police used water cannons and police dogs against the protesters, even against children. When this was shown on national TV, many white Americans were shocked. The Birmingham campaign was successful and African Americans now had more access 8 to public places. ‘White Only’ and ‘Black Only’ signs were removed from restrooms 9 , for example. Early in the Birmingham campaign, King had been arrested again. In his cell he realized that freedom for African-American people would be a long and hard struggle 10 . Later that year King helped organize the March on Washington on August 28, 1963. Its goal was to protest against the way African Americans were treated in Southern states. The protesters wanted an end to racial segregation in schools and at work. They also wanted to protect workers from police brutality. More than 250,000 people joined the march. At the time it was the largest meeting of protesters in the history of Washington, D.C. During this event King gave his most famous speech – ‘I have a dream’. It became one of the greatest American speeches. Soon after, civil rights became the most important goal for black and white reformers in the United States. Most of the civil rights became law in 1964 and 1965. King got the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 for his role in the Civil Rights Movement. He was also named ‘Person of the Year’ by Time magazine. In March 1968 King went to Memphis, Tennessee. He wanted to support African-American workers there who were on strike 11 against bad working conditions. On April 4, 1968 he was shot. James Earl Ray, a white escaped convict 12 , was arrested and was sentenced 13 to 99 years in prison. Since 1983 the third Monday in January has become a national holiday 14 in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. The house where King was born and his grave in Atlanta are national monuments. Streets in towns and cities all over the United States have been named after him. King was the leader of the Civil Rights Movement for almost 13 years. During that time African Americans made a lot of progress on the way towards equality 15 in America. However, many black Americans still experience racial discrimination today. King is known as one of the greatest non-violent leaders in world history. ___ 1 minister [ˈmɪnɪstə] − Pfarrer, Pfarrerin ; 2 civil rights [ˌsɪvl ˈraɪts] − Bürgerrechte ; 3 segregated [ˈsegrɪgeɪtɪd] − getrennt (nach Hautfarbe) ; 4 campaign [kӕˈpeɪn] − Kampagne, Aktion ; 5 illegal [ɪˈli:gl] − illegal, gesetzeswidrig ; 6 victory [ˈvɪktri] − Sieg ; 7 to achieve [əˈt∫i:v] − erreichen ; 8 access [ˈӕkses] − Zugang, Zutritt ; 9 restroom [ˈrestˌrʊm] − Toilette ; 10 struggle [ˈstrʌgl] − Kampf ; 11 to be on strike [ɒn ˈstraɪk] − streiken ; 12 escaped convict [ɪˌskeɪpd ˈkɒnvɪkt] − flüchtiger Sträfling ; 13 to sentence [ˈsentəns] − verurteilen ; 14 national holiday [ˌnӕ∫nl ˈhɒlədeɪ] − (nationaler) Feiertag ; 15 equality [ɪˈkwɒləti] − Gleichheit   What should I do? He didn’t tell me. Clara ( online ) 15th June 2021, 19:17 Hi Linda, I don’t know what to do. I’m 17 and my boyfriend, Danny, is 19. Danny is the coolest guy in the world – and he’s so cute. We’ve been together since last April. I still go to school in Christchurch, but Danny left school two months ago. I thought he was only looking for a job in Christchurch. Then last week, while we were walking to the cinema, he told me that he got a job as an apprentice chef at a hotel in Wellington. He told me after he had already accepted the job. I was so upset! Danny said that there were no jobs here and he really needed one. We could video chat every day and he would come back to Christchurch whenever he could. But it takes a whole day to get to Wellington by train and ferry. That’s too far! I really love Danny and I don’t want to lose him. We belong together! I’m thinking about leaving school and living with him in Wellington. Of course, my parents don’t understand. We had a big argument and haven’t really made up since. They just told me to concentrate on school. Please help me. I really need some advice. Clara RE: He didn’t tell me. Linda ( online ) 16th June 2021, 8:55 Hello Clara, I understand how you feel. Danny means everything to you. You want to spend every minute with him. Now Danny made an important decision without discussing it with you first. That hurts, doesn’t it? Maybe it’s time to talk about what each of you really wants. Ask yourself: What do you want? What are you worried about? Is it really only because Wellington is so far away, or don’t you trust your boyfriend? Are you afraid that he will cheat on you? How would you feel about breaking up? Whatever you do, don’t make decisions now that you may not be happy about later. If you want to stay together, you could stay with Danny during the school holidays for a start. That might be OK for your parents. You could still move in with him later, after you’ve finished school. Good luck! Linda",,3912

They decide to go on a trip to find the boy’s body and prepare for the trip. The Gun My room was on the second floor, and it was really hot up there. I was glad I wasn’t sleeping there that night, and the thought of where we were going made me excited again. I rolled up two blankets and tied an old belt around them. I grabbed all my money, which was less than a dollar. Then I was ready to go. I went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad. I was walking up Carbine Street towards the clubhouse when Chris caught up with me. His eyes were shining. “Gordie! You want to see something?” “Sure. What?” “Come down here first.” He pointed down an alley between two shops. “What is it, Chris?” “Come on, I said!” He ran down the alley and I ran after him. At the bottom, the smell from the trash was terrible. “Chris, I’m going to puke, I’m – ” But I forgot about the smell when Chris put his hand into his backpack and pulled out a big gun. “Where did you get that?” “From my dad’s desk.” “Man, your dad’s going to beat you when he finds out.” Chris’s eyes just went on dancing. “He isn’t going to find out. He and his friends have got enough wine to keep them drunk for a week. I’ll put it back before then.” Chris hated alcohol – he’d already seen too much of what it can do. He was the only one of us who didn’t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they’d stolen from their father. “Have you got bullets for it?” “Nine of them – all that was left in the box. He’ll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.” “Any in it at the moment?” “No, of course not. What do you think I am?” I finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA – BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin – it was the work of an evil magician. “Wow!” I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn’t tell if he was amused or scared. “You did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!” “Shut up! Let’s go!” I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. “Man, it’s a pity you couldn’t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.” “You knew there was a bullet in it, didn’t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.” “I didn’t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad’s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.” Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, “What do you think we need a gun for?” “Nothing, really,” Chris said. “Except we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it’s frightening out in the forest at night.” Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?” Teddy asked Vern. “Yeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it’ll look as if we’re there after dark.” “Hey, man, great!” I said, and slapped Vern on the back. For him, that was real thinking. He grinned. “So let’s go,” Teddy said. “It’s nearly twelve already.” Chris stood up and we gathered round him. “We’ll walk across Beeman’s field,” he said, “and then we’ll get to the railway tracks and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.” “How far is it, do you think?” Teddy asked. “I don’t know,” said Chris. “Harlow’s big. We’re going to have to walk at least twenty miles. Does that sound right to you, Gordie?” “Yeah. Maybe more – thirty miles.” “Come on, you guys,” Chris said, and picked up his backpack, blankets and water bottle. Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? headline written by Pam Warner (published 07/12/16 in Health & Style ) author, date, source What is your Thanksgiving like? Turkey and pumpkin pie? American football on the sofa? In the last couple of years a new trend has become popular in the USA: More people like to eat better quality food and live a more active life. introduction It is slowly going out of fashion to live off convenience and frozen food. A number of people shop for organic food at special supermarkets instead. In some states farmers’ markets offer a great variety of fresh vegetables and fruit from the region. “There are also dairy products, bread and meat without chemical additives at these markets. Organic food is not only much healthier but it tastes a lot better as well,” explains Emma from Boston. So how about some healthy recipes for Thanksgiving? Maybe pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes? A roast turkey breast or a turkey roulade filled with apples and cranberries is delicious too. But there’s more to a healthy lifestyle than just food. A lot of trend sports show that you can have fun, spend time with friends and stay fit at the same time. Have you found the right sport for you yet? If not, here is a suggestion: How about standup paddleboarding? If you like water, that’s the ideal kind of sport for you. You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don’t worry, you don’t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: “Drinking too much alcohol isn’t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?” Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don’t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion",,1410
3137,1QPhN3J8uLV922tAqHajDv,EN,"Write a poem or a chant about working in a coal mine. This is the first verse: I’m working in a coal mine, I’m always tired, I have to work hard, don’t want to get fired! Make up more verses like this. Help: only eat bread / soon be dead gas smell / don’t feel well coal mine – dirty / get old? – be thirty Billy – my friend / … the end …  ""A deadly silence

1. My name is Jonas Fox and I’m twelve years old. I work in the mines and my job is to sit near a door in the tunnel every day. I must open the door when the coal arrives. Then, after it’s gone, I quickly close the door again. Every day I sit in the dark, but I’m never scared. That’s because my friend Billy is always there with me. Billy sings all day long. He’s yellow with little black eyes which look like they are made of glass. Billy is a canary, you see? It’s never boring with Billy around. I would love to sing too, but I can’t even talk. 2. Sometimes there is gas in the mine. And when gas touches a flame, it explodes. Last year a terrible gas explosion in a mine killed 30 miners and ten boys. A canary notices gas much sooner than a man. So when the canaries sing, the tunnels are OK. But if they go quiet, you know that there’s gas in the mine. Their deadly silence tells you that you must hurry. You only have a few minutes to leave the tunnels. 3. My brother, Bart, worked in the mine too. We always ate bread and laughed together on the way to the mine. One day Bart started to cough and he never stopped coughing after that. Then one night my brother coughed so badly that he died. That was when I stopped talking. I don’t know why, really. I still had words in my head and I opened my mouth, but I couldn’t speak. The men in the mine started to call me ‘Silent Jonas’ after that. They probably thought I was a bit strange. 4. The day when things got really bad started like any other. Billy was singing like he always did. I heard the people in the tunnels and the noise of the coal trucks. I opened the door and I felt a cold wind in the tunnel. I closed the door again. Billy stopped singing. For a moment I didn’t understand. But then, suddenly, I did: There was gas in the mine! And it could explode any second. I didn’t have time to run down the tunnel to warn the men. If only I could talk, if only I could shout! 5. I knew I had to warn everyone in the mine. So I opened my mouth and tried to say it: “Gas.” But there was no sound. Nothing came out. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth again. Nothing. I panicked. We could die in here – I had to speak! I tried again. This time the sound was quiet, but I made a sound. At last! I opened the door and shouted, “Gas. Gas. GAS!” A moment later I heard the sound of the miners’ boots in the tunnels. I took Billy’s cage and ran too. 6. I ran through the tunnel as fast as I could. But my head hurt and I couldn’t breathe in the gas. Suddenly I heard a voice. I couldn’t tell where it was coming from. “Come on, boy!” it said. Somebody picked me up. I turned around and saw that it was one of the miners. He took me out of the mine. All this time I still had Billy’s cage with me, but I was sure he was dead. I couldn’t just leave him in there, could I? He was my friend, you know. At last we were outside and I could breathe again. 7. BOOM! The sound of the explosion was awful. My ears hurt. I closed my eyes because they were sore too. Then I opened them again and looked around. I saw that the men and boys from the mine were all safe outside. Somebody asked, “Who warned us?” “Me!” I said. They were so surprised; they all looked at me with their mouths open. When they could speak again, everyone said thank you. “Silent Jonas found his voice!” a miner shouted. But how could I feel happy? My friend Billy had died. I looked in his cage to say goodbye to him. Suddenly I heard a small ‘Tweet’. Billy was alive! I opened the cage …

There were canaries in mines until 1987. Today miners use machines to find out if there is gas in the mine.""",,805

Fruit is a collective term of the raw, mostly water -containing fruits or parts of them (e.g. seeds) that come from trees, bushes and perennials. In Germany, the average daily consumption of fruit and obstacle certificates (without fruit juices) is 230 grams for men and 278 grams for men. The United Nations General Assembly appointed the International Year of the Fruit and Vermins in 2021. The term fruit (Old High German Obaz, Middle High German OB (e) Z, Early High German Obs; ""fruit, tree fruit"") stands out from the relationship word OB and a verbal nomas related to food with an output meaning 'covering' (for basic food), originally prisely fruits, originallytogether. The Unorganic Tendus has been performing since the 16th Century on. The name is community Germanic, see Mittelniederedeutsch ōvet, āvet, ōves, ōvest, middle -aged and Dutch ooft as well as Altenglisch ofet (t). The distinction between fruit and vegetables is not organic, but cultural and therefore blurred. As a rule, fruit of several years and vegetables comes from one -year -old plants (according to food definition). The sugar content in the fruit is usually higher. From a botanical point of view, fruit arises from the fertilized flower, vegetables arise from other parts of the plant. Paprika, tomatoes, pumpkins, zucchini, eggplants and cucumbers are fruits and, according to the above (botanical) definition, belong to fruit (since they arise from fertilized flowers), but are used as annual plants (food definition: vegetables) and are generally because of the lack of sweetnessor acid referred to as fruit vegetables. Rhubarb, on the other hand, is a leaf stick, but is also used as fruit. The division of fruit described below into fruit start groups (core fruit, stone fruit, exotic fruits, etc.) is the usual today. In the botany, on the other hand, under the collective term, fruit is summarized “all those seeds and fruits of cultivated or wildly growing plants that are generally eaten raw and are of pleasant, mostly sweet or sour taste. If these are seeds, they are also very nutritious due to the high sugar content and the associated high energy content, while fruits, whose seeds are often not consumed, usually have pulp with a high water content and therefore only low nutritional value. Thanks to their content of vitamins and mineral salts, they […] represent an important addition to food […]. """,,374

3894,9Go2lKzLoO06kwx41uGekb,EN,"According to the text, what makes it so difficult for Vladik to do a new trick on stage? Some people might be good at their jobs, but performer Vladik
Miagkostoupov was actually born to do his! Raised by two Moscow
Circus performers, young Vladik was tutored early on by his juggler
father. By age nine, he’d perfected enough of his natural acrobatic and
juggling skills to work full time with the circus. Combining a seamless mix of acrobatics, dance and juggling, the star
has performed with a range of companies in Paris and Monte Carlo. Several years ago, Vladik – who is now 28, married and a dad – began
as a character in Dralion, an epic performance piece. What will most appeal to kids about this show? For children, the clowns! The show itself, I’m sure the kids will love
because there are a lot of acrobatics. There’s a lot of movement. It’s
very colourful. It’s an uplifting show. You leave feeling happy. There’s
always something going on onstage. You’ve performed this character for many years, since
2006. How often does your routine in Dralion change? I’m always changing it. This routine I’ve actually been doing for 14
years. Every time I look at it, I’m putting in a new trick or changing the
choreography. It’s constantly changing. This text is an interview with Vladik Miagkostoupov, a juggler and acrobat
with a famous travelling circus. My Circus Life Interview by Kari Kamin

Do those changes happen naturally, or are you looking
for ways to change it? Sometimes those changes happen naturally, yeah. Sometimes I say
to myself, “Wait a minute! I’m doing this differently.” I don’t know
how it even happens. Some things, of course, I modify deliberately;
I add a trick in or something. It’s easy to do it in practice. I have
many, many tricks in training. But when you’re on stage, it’s different
because you really have to have it perfect. Especially because you
get used to doing the same things for that long. So when you start
to put in something new, you automatically feel your body doing
something wrong. [Laughs]
How does your daughter react to your act? Actually, she likes it! After she was ten months old, she started
walking. You know when they start walking, they just run away. Surprisingly when you watch a show with her,
as soon as we sit down, she’s sitting there,
watching the show. I don’t know; maybe
she’ll be a performer also. Did you react similarly
when your father performed? Yeah, yeah! All the shows they were
doing, the kids were running around
backstage. For me, I really liked watching. Are there any particular lessons
your father taught you that you
still use today? Everything he taught me! [Laughs] He taught
me everything. One main thing: if you want
to juggle, try and take dance classes. Do
some other stuff, especially dance and
acting. It helps you be a better performer. As a performer, you should be able to move
well onstage and present yourself. It’s very
important. I was lucky because my parents
started taking me to dance classes when I
was four years old. That’s a big part of it. My act is more performance juggling. I do
movement and acrobatics, so it’s not just
static juggling. It makes it more interesting.",,563
