14,3905,8hW5143vdgva4PKovWxXap,EN,Expand this linear expression using the distributive property. ${5(3x + y - 8)}$,"Understanding the Concept: The distributive property is a rule that helps break down expressions with parentheses into simpler parts. Think of it as distributing or spreading a number across all items inside the parentheses.

Why It’s Useful: This rule is fundamental in algebra and helps simplify expressions, making them easier to work with and solve.

How It Works:

Identify the number outside the parentheses.
This number needs to be multiplied by each individual part inside the parentheses, one at a time.
Step-by-Step Process:

Start with the expression that has a number outside and multiple parts inside the parentheses.
Multiply the number outside by the first part inside the parentheses.
Next, multiply the same number by the second part inside the parentheses.
Continue this process for each part inside the parentheses.
Combine all these results to form a new, simpler expression without parentheses.
Visualizing the Process: Imagine you have several items in a bag, and you have multiple such bags. To find the total number of each item, you would multiply the number of bags by the number of each item in one bag and add them up.

Real-Life Application: Picture buying multiple bundles of products. If each bundle contains various items, you would multiply the number of bundles by the quantity of each item in a single bundle to find the total for each item.

Practice Makes Perfect: To get better at this, practice with different expressions to get used to distributing the number across all parts inside the parentheses and combining the results.",,13,2

They decide to go on a trip to find the boy’s body and prepare for the trip. The Gun My room was on the second floor, and it was really hot up there. I was glad I wasn’t sleeping there that night, and the thought of where we were going made me excited again. I rolled up two blankets and tied an old belt around them. I grabbed all my money, which was less than a dollar. Then I was ready to go. I went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad. I was walking up Carbine Street towards the clubhouse when Chris caught up with me. His eyes were shining. “Gordie! You want to see something?” “Sure. What?” “Come down here first.” He pointed down an alley between two shops. “What is it, Chris?” “Come on, I said!” He ran down the alley and I ran after him. At the bottom, the smell from the trash was terrible. “Chris, I’m going to puke, I’m – ” But I forgot about the smell when Chris put his hand into his backpack and pulled out a big gun. “Where did you get that?” “From my dad’s desk.” “Man, your dad’s going to beat you when he finds out.” Chris’s eyes just went on dancing. “He isn’t going to find out. He and his friends have got enough wine to keep them drunk for a week. I’ll put it back before then.” Chris hated alcohol – he’d already seen too much of what it can do. He was the only one of us who didn’t have a drink when the DeSpain brothers brought some beer they’d stolen from their father. “Have you got bullets for it?” “Nine of them – all that was left in the box. He’ll think he used them himself, shooting at bottles when he was drunk.” “Any in it at the moment?” “No, of course not. What do you think I am?” I finally took the gun. I liked the heavy way it sat in my hand. I pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly trash spilling out of it and squeezed. KA – BLAM! The gun jumped in my hand. Fire shot from the end. It felt as if my wrist was broken. My heart was in my mouth. A big hole appeared in the tin – it was the work of an evil magician. “Wow!” I screamed. Chris was laughing wildly; I couldn’t tell if he was amused or scared. “You did it, you did it! Gordie Lachance is shooting Castle Rock to pieces. Be careful, everyone! Here comes Gordie!” “Shut up! Let’s go!” I screamed, and grabbed him by the shirt. I gave the gun to Chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley. When we reached Carbine Street we slowed to a walk, so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun. Chris was still laughing. “Man, it’s a pity you couldn’t see your face. Oh, man, that was really great.” “You knew there was a bullet in it, didn’t you? That was a mean trick, Chris, really.” “I didn’t know, Gordie, honestly. I just took it out of my dad’s desk. He always takes the bullets out of it. I guess he was too drunk to remember last time.” Chris looked as innocent as a baby, but when we got to the clubhouse we found Vern and Teddy waiting, and he started to laugh again. He told them the whole story, and after everyone had had a good laugh Teddy asked Chris, “What do you think we need a gun for?” “Nothing, really,” Chris said. “Except we might see a wild animal. And anyway, it’s frightening out in the forest at night.” Everyone agreed with that. Chris was the strongest and bravest guy of us all, and he could say things like that. Did you put your tent up in the field?” Teddy asked Vern. “Yeah, and I put two lamps in it and turned them on, so it’ll look as if we’re there after dark.” “Hey, man, great!” I said, and slapped Vern on the back. For him, that was real thinking. He grinned. “So let’s go,” Teddy said. “It’s nearly twelve already.” Chris stood up and we gathered round him. “We’ll walk across Beeman’s field,” he said, “and then we’ll get to the railway tracks and just walk across the bridge into Harlow.” “How far is it, do you think?” Teddy asked. “I don’t know,” said Chris. “Harlow’s big. We’re going to have to walk at least twenty miles. Does that sound right to you, Gordie?” “Yeah. Maybe more – thirty miles.” “Come on, you guys,” Chris said, and picked up his backpack, blankets and water bottle.   Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? Healthy and active at Thanksgiving? headline written by Pam Warner (published 07/12/16 in Health & Style ) author, date, source What is your Thanksgiving like? Turkey and pumpkin pie? American football on the sofa? In the last couple of years a new trend has become popular in the USA: More people like to eat better quality food and live a more active life. introduction It is slowly going out of fashion to live off convenience and frozen food. A number of people shop for organic food at special supermarkets instead. In some states farmers’ markets offer a great variety of fresh vegetables and fruit from the region. “There are also dairy products, bread and meat without chemical additives at these markets. Organic food is not only much healthier but it tastes a lot better as well,” explains Emma from Boston. So how about some healthy recipes for Thanksgiving? Maybe pumpkin soup or mashed sweet potatoes? A roast turkey breast or a turkey roulade filled with apples and cranberries is delicious too. But there’s more to a healthy lifestyle than just food. A lot of trend sports show that you can have fun, spend time with friends and stay fit at the same time. Have you found the right sport for you yet? If not, here is a suggestion: How about standup paddleboarding? If you like water, that’s the ideal kind of sport for you. You stand on the board and you use a paddle to move through the water. Don’t worry, you don’t have to travel to the sea. A lot of clubs offer standup paddleboarding on lakes and rivers. Of course living healthy also means avoiding alcohol and drugs. Finn, a fitness instructor from Cleveland, says: “Drinking too much alcohol isn’t good for your health. Most alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and negative effects on your fitness too. So why not try a smoothie instead?” Drugs are even worse. You can easily get addicted, and they often cause problems with your family or at school. main part To sum up, you can say that organic food together with doing sports is a great way to stay fit. You don’t have to do without your favorite meals. Just changing your lifestyle a bit will make you a much happier person. conclusion ",,190,23

Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy – after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world’s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren’t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is ‘fracking’, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, “Fracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.” But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada’s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. “We haven’t seen the end of this yet,” says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. “CO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.” 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven’t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won’t change. “What worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,” he adds. “It will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.” Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable – which means that when we have used them up, there simply won’t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada’s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better – and we will have to.   The sound of ice I’m standing on the ice, looking back at our ship for the last time. The HMS Erebus is in the same place off King William Island that she has been for nearly two years. A little further behind her I see the HMS Terror, also stuck in the ice. There is activity as crew from both ships load supplies and the sick men onto boats and sledges. Commander Fitzjames has checked to make sure we all have warm clothes on before we start walking south. Thankfully it is April now, and the sun is shining today. The months from November to March are terrible this far north. I was expecting to feel cold much of the time, but I had not imagined what it would feel like not to see the sun for months. However, I have experienced many things which I couldn’t have imagined when I began this voyage. Back then I had never been further north from Kent than London. Now, I am almost as far north as a man can go on earth and we are about to leave our ships to walk into the icy wilderness to find help. Many of our crew are sick and dying; we are all starving. How did we get to this point? Things were so different at the beginning of the voyage. Everything was going well after we left Greenland behind in July 1845. I had already had experience of working as a ship’s doctor, having worked on other ships for seven years. My job was to look after Sir John Franklin, the captain of the Erebus and the officers. Those first months at sea were busy and exciting. We had good winds and made progress to the northwest. Two of the senior officers often made trips onto land to do their scientific experiments. Back on the ship, they would try to explain how the magnetic readings they took on the coast were to make a magnetic chart of the world. They had to be far away from the ships to do this work, as any metal objects nearby would affect the readings. The officers were optimistic and excited. They told us that science and discovery were going to change the world. They believed their work would make sure that the British Empire would stay the most powerful nation on earth. Captain Franklin was also sure that it was only a question of time before we found a way through the ice and discovered the ‘northwest passage’, a sea route from Europe to Asia. All that didn’t mean much to most of the men on the ship, though. They found their entertainment watching Jacko, the ship’s monkey, dance around or do tricks for carrots from our tinned food rations. The monkey stole things from time to time and ran around the ship with them, but all the men on board liked her anyway. It’s a strange feeling to be leaving our ships behind. Of the 129 crew members who were with me at the start of this voyage in 1845, there are now only 105 still alive. People think that ice is still and silent. I have learned that this is not the case. Our first winter camp, from 1845 to 1846, was near Beechey Island. It was a good location, near land, and it was a good place to hunt. We added rabbits and partridges to our rations and even had a winter party on the ice, under bright torches. However, everything started to go wrong when one of our crew died there on the first day of 1846. Two more men passed away while we were still at that camp and we buried them there. The weather didn’t change much until June. After we could finally continue our journey, we’d only been at sea for a few weeks before we came to an ice river. Reid, our ice master, led us through difficult waters filled with fast-moving blocks of ice the size of houses. The temperature dropped and the sea quickly froze around the ships. The noise was terrible. It was easy to imagine a monster roaming around outside making those sounds. Thankfully the temperature rose enough to release us before the ice crushed our ships to pieces. But the thaw didn’t last long and we had hardly travelled any distance before the temperature dropped again and the ice forced us to make camp where we had got stuck. That is how we ended up here, off King William Island, in September of 1846. This is a terrible, empty place. There seem to be no wild animals or birds anywhere around. Still sledging parties went out onto land to hunt, hoping to add some fresh meat to our rations. They came back with nothing. The best they did was to kill several seals, but those tasted terrible and made us all feel ill. We somehow got through one winter here, though. Spirits were still high and through the long, dark nights we put on concerts and theatre shows for our entertainment. We were hoping that in the spring the ice would melt and allow us to continue our voyage. But the promised thaw did not arrive. The most awful thing then happened on 11th June 1847 when Sir John Franklin died. He had become ill with what seemed to be a cold. I did my best to attend to him, but still he got weaker and weaker. Commander Fitzjames became our new leader. The weather showed no sign of change and the ice had stopped our wonderful voyage of discovery. When I look back now I only see this as the time when the men began getting sick. Was the lack of fresh food making the men sick? Or was the reason the isolation of being out here in this endless white wilderness? The only other people we met in all this time was a party of five Inuit hunters who showed up one day travelling across the ice with their dog team. They spoke no English, so the officers used sign language and pictures drawn on the ice to communicate with them. They were here to hunt seals. Even the Inuit were struggling to find food because the weather had been so bad this year. Fitzjames invited one of the Inuit men on board, and with his help the officers got a better idea of our location on the maps. The crew invited the Inuit to come on board for dinner, but at dusk they disappeared with their dogs. And we never saw them again. Another winter passed here. We felt like trapped animals on our ships. I advised Commander Fitzjames to increase the ration of lemon juice, thinking that it was scurvy that made so many of the men tired and sick. But it didn’t make any difference. Our only source of food was the salted meat and tinned soups and vegetables in our stores. However, some of our tinned food had gone bad and some of the food had large pieces of metal in it from the soldering. Was it the tinned food that made us sick? I remembered that Jacko, the monkey, had loved the tinned carrots and that was all she ate. They remembered how she ran around the ship madly before she died. So it is, with our energy gone and our crew sick and dying, that on this day, 22nd April 1848, Commander Fitzjames made the decision to leave the ships and start walking, trying to make it to Back’s Fish River. We closed the ships and made them secure. Perhaps if the thaw comes suddenly those fit enough can come back to them and sail out of this terrible situation. Who knows what lies ahead of us, but surely it can’t be worse than going mad or dying here. I see movement. The men have loaded all the boats and sledges. I will take my place next to those fit enough to pull them across the ice. Let’s hope we find some food or meet some Inuit who can help us to find a trading post. I’m taking one last look at the ship that has been my home for the past three years and then we will travel into the unknown. Stephen Samuel Stanley – ship’s doctor, HMS Erebus   In New Zealand   Working in India Get to know India and work as a volunteer Teaching young children in an orphanage in Jaipur Building and repairing schools in Goa Helping stray dogs in Ranchi For more information contact Mrs Lal. (a.lal@vii.com) My name is Emma De Santis. I’m from Germany and I’m 18 years old. I took part in a project at an orphanage in Jaipur last year. My English isn’t bad and I used to work as a babysitter for our neighbours’ kids. I could choose to work from four weeks to ten months. I decided to stay for eight weeks. Before I went to India, I had to get all the important papers. I also knew that I would have to pay the organization almost €2,000. The flight was not included. So I decided to work in a supermarket to earn the money. When I got the contract for the project in India, I booked my flight and I was ready to go. When I arrived in Jaipur, I was very tired from the journey and the time difference. The heat, the noise and the smells made it even worse. But I still remember a cow lying in front of the phone shop. During the orientation days I met other volunteers from different countries, which was great. After that I met my host family. They were very friendly people. However, I was homesick during the first days, and I had some problems with the food. It was so spicy. At the time I thought, “If I don’t feel better soon, I’ll have to quit.” But I got over it quickly. My job was great but challenging too. The working conditions were OK. I was teaching 10-year-old girls English and organizing some free-time activities for the younger ones. The staff were very helpful. They all spoke English, which made things a little easier. I quickly found out that things are different in India. Most people’s attitude in India is “Whatever happens, happens.” And usually that’s OK for everyone. Wherever I went, people were smiling at me. But they didn’t just show interest in me, many of them actually stared at me. But you learn to ignore it. I can really recommend taking part in a project like this. I met wonderful people, made new friends and learned a lot about myself. If you go to India, you’ll never forget it. ",,16,3

87,3065,4fHzBC8AGaM6WS2QwbGMt3,EN,Look at the structure of the text We can do even better . How does the author finish?,"  We can do even better – by Lindsay Fern (21/1/2017) 1. Our country is rich in natural resources, like gas, oil, wood and water. Canada is also a world leader in using its natural resources to produce energy. Compared to other countries, we are doing quite well when it comes to using modern technology and renewable energy – after all, Canada produces ten percent of the world’s electricity produced from water power. But are we doing enough? 2. Canada mainly relies on traditional resources, like natural gas and oil, for energy. Over the last couple of years, technology has improved so much that today we have access to oil and gas reserves that weren’t available before. But these ways of exploiting natural resources come with their own particular problems. They seriously affect the environment. A good example is ‘fracking’, where a mixture of chemicals, sand and huge amounts of water is used. This mixture is pushed into the ground under great pressure in order to break open the rock which holds the gas. After that the gas rises and can be collected. Clara Hall, an expert on energy technology, explains, “Fracking has allowed us to extract natural gas that is very deep in the ground.” But there is not enough information available on which chemicals are used for fracking. The local people are afraid that these chemicals could poison them and pollute nearby rivers. Even worse, in some places the damage done to the ground by fracking has already caused earthquakes. There is always the danger of a major explosion when dealing with gas. Oil is a controversial source of energy too. Most of Canada’s oil comes from the oil sands of Alberta. Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and very heavy oil. They cover a huge area of the province. In the past it was too expensive to get the oil out of this mixture, but in the last 30 years the price of oil has increased so much that it has become financially worth it. In addition, there is a political advantage: if Canada has its own source of oil, it will become more independent from other countries. But a lot of people worry about the pollution that the extraction of oil may cause. “We haven’t seen the end of this yet,” says Jeff Tanner, a protester who leads the campaign against the oil companies. “CO2 emissions from the oil sands are very high. This project not only disturbs animals in their normal lives, but the oil companies have also destroyed a huge area where millions of wild animals, like rare birds, used to live.” 3. There is also another problem: transport. Since the decision to build a new pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, the protests haven’t stopped. Supporters of the project claim that it will create thousands of new jobs in the oil industry and reduce fuel prices. They say that the new pipeline will be able to transport a lot more oil than at present. Jeff Tanner, however, thinks that there will only be a few new jobs and most of them will be temporary. As most of the oil will be exported, the prices for oil in Canada won’t change. “What worries us most are leaks in the pipeline,” he adds. “It will cross miles of farmland and many rivers. A leak could do great damage to both people and wildlife.” Many experts agree with his view. 4. And then, of course, there is the problem that oil and gas are not renewable – which means that when we have used them up, there simply won’t be any more. Sooner or later we will have to replace them completely. Using the power of moving water can be one way of doing that. At the time of writing, 7% of Canada’s energy came from water power. There are water power plants all across the country; the biggest project is the James Bay Project in Quebec. However, these projects often also affect and change large regions. 5. In addition, we have been increasing the amount of energy produced from wind over the last few years and there are new projects to use geothermal energy too. It takes heat from deep in the earth and uses it to heat water. The hot water drives a power plant, which produces electricity. But both activists like Jeff Tanner and experts like Clara Hall think that we need to concentrate on renewable energy sources even more to make Canada ready for the future. We can do even better – and we will have to. ",,18,2

Find more information about the product here: digione.ch Why I love Edinburgh I first visited Edinburgh as a child with my parents and my sister. I thought it was a magical city with a very special atmosphere. It’s small enough to get around easily and not feel lost, but big enough that there’s a lot to do. So after I left school, I decided to go to university there. It was a good decision – I had a wonderful time! The locals were really friendly and after some time I even started to understand the Edinburgh accent. In fact, I loved Edinburgh so much that I stayed after university. At first I lived and worked in the city, but after I met my husband (who is a true Scotsman!) we moved to the countryside nearby. I work from home now as I have my own business. But I love to drive to the city at the weekend in my Mini. Last week my parents came to stay and we visited Edinburgh Castle and the Scottish National Gallery. One day we took the children to the zoo, and another day we took a boat out to Inchcolm Abbey on a nearby island. Most days we had a picnic lunch in the Princes Street Gardens.I love that there are so many different things to do in Edinburgh. This city really has become my home now. I couldn’t imagine moving away! Answer the question in a full sentence: Why did Caroline move to Edinburgh? (""She moved to Edinburgh to study and because she loved the city.”)",,,271,19
